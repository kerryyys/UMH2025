3,Elon Musk Is Not One Of Us. Stop Using Him As a Role Model.,36968,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mntcz3/elon_musk_is_not_one_of_us_stop_using_him_as_a/,3012,"I’m tired of seeing him as a face of crypto in news. He is not one of us. He isn’t your average Joe. He is multi billionaire, one of the richest guys in the world. He doesn’t care about you, about me, about mine or your family. All he cares it’s his ego and his companies.

Lately, we’ve seen a lot of hate towards Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook. Is sweet Elon Musk different? Maybe he isn’t lizardy as Marky is, because he is skrull from Mars. Is Elon any different compared to Mark? Both of them are shilling their own companies, Tesla isn’t different. Just because he offers you to buy Tesla with BTC, it doesn’t mean that he is on your side. He isn’t helping you, he is helping himself. 

While you’re laughing at him shilling DOGE, he is laughing at you how is he manipulating you. He is not helping crypto, he is hurting it. He isn’t same as you or me, he doesn’t have to save money for food, he doesn’t have the count if he has enough for dinner. 

He isn’t on your side, every one of the billionaires are trying to manipulate as much people as they can, to make them believe in theirs own visions and dreams. Just because he pumped your coin, it doesn’t mean that he is your lovely neighbour. 

Elon shouldn’t be used as a model for crypto. Just because he was on Joe Rogan podcast, it isn’t making him a proper role model.

21,A wallet is not what you think it is,20947,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n1vwak/a_wallet_is_not_what_you_think_it_is/,1739,"If you're new to the space, here is a quick 101 on wallets.

Metamask, Electrum, MEW, Trust, Coinomi, Atomic or whatever other application you call a wallet is not really a wallet.

They are **wallet applications** that allow you to access and manage your cryptocurrency, NFTs or whatever blockchain asset you have stored in your wallet.

**Your wallet is your private key or seed phrase.**

For example:

* You download Metamask
* It gives you the option to create a seed phrase/private key
* The same seed phrase you can import to other applications like Trust, MEW, Atomic and your ETH will be accessible on both Metamask and those applications.

So next time you download a new wallet application, you don't have to create a new seed phrase, you can just import the one you already have to manage your existing funds in both applications.

Just thought I'd share this since I work in crypto and I noticed that a lot of users don't know this.

EDIT: I felt obliged to add that this is the reason you should never ever share your private keys with anyone. Your keys are your sole access to your assets on the blockchain so keep them secure.

22,I made a post about the scam OpisHub yesterday. The scammers didn't like that and bought downvotes to make my post invisible. So this is an even more detailed post about them.,20888,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o7k0b4/i_made_a_post_about_the_scam_opishub_yesterday/,599,"Yesterday I made [a post](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o6zy0e/scam_warning_if_you_see_posts_praising_opishub_on/) about OpisHub. It's still up, but the main point was that they approached me to shill their shitcoin for money and that they are really shady, it has many red flags and very much looks like a scam.

Then one of the scammers (Scammer 2) sent me a message that he didn't like it, and that I was deleting his comments on my post (lol he has less than 50 comment karma, they just got deleted, of course I didn't do anything). My post only had like 35 or 50 upvotes at this point and it had already been 2 hours since I posted, the post wouldn't have become very big - but the scammers decided to buy downvotes, bringing it to below 0 within minutes, [see also here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o75scd/the_scammers_behind_opishub_didnt_like_the_post_i/h2wxc7e/). The mods deleted a post about this that I made yesterday (because it broke another rule, so I understand - but that post is probably also the reason why my original post is above 0 again), so here I go again: these guys are obviously shady, some examples:

* one of them (the one that originally approached me, Scammer 1), [pretended to have just stumbled across the project](https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/) instead of saying that he was part of the project **EDIT:** just saw that the post was deleted, it's archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429143341/https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/)
* they wanted to pay me (and most likely others) to shill their project
* they [openly told me](https://imgur.com/a/rgw1HsB) they would do vote manipulation and upvote my posts about them and then, well, bought downvotes

So even if the coin would not be a total scam - which I really think it is - they are obviously doing shady stuff. I have already listed the obvious red flags that make them look like your average scam coin, here they are again, slightly adapted:

* they use your phone's CPU for mining
* the CPU is used to power scientific research (of course they don't say what ""scientific research"" they are talking about anywhere). And I work in science: of course I would rather use the CPU of a few phones than, well, the powerful computers we have, just as much as I would rather ride a few cats that are tied together than a horse
* ""each transaction gives a small % to charity""
* they plan to be super eco friendly and plant trees
* ""our primary promotional point is that it adds people's incentive to get  their friends and family on board , therefore we will have a reffer@l scheme in place"", so it's officially a pyramid scheme
* the token (and app) will launch soon ™

Scammer 1 had also told me they ""have received £3.5million pounds in the last week to utilise to get this project off the ground"". If you look at their social media activity etc., it's all extremely basic and unprofessional (but check out their Twitter, it's kind of funny - they really try to seem ""sciency"" but don't really know anything about science I think. The followers are either also bought or baited by some fake giveaways, very few seem to be normal, non-spammy accounts) - no company with multiple millions funding would present themselves like that. Also look at the [start of the email](https://imgur.com/a/tbq5YZ9) they sent me in beautiful red, Scammer 1 didn't even remove the ""initial contact"", which I think is hilarious.

So again, if you see positive posts about this project, it's either the scammers or people with less morals that they approached. Stay away from them as far as possible, at least don't give them money, your personal information, or go to their website/ download their app so they can send you viruses.",2021-06-25 09:06:59

* **In order for the Market Cap (Top Number) to go up, many people would have to buy dogecoin**, but many people understand this is a meme coin or a pump/dump coin. They are using this as short term profit or self entertainment because there is no long term adoptation compare to other crypto currency projects.
* **In order for the Circulating Supply (Bottom Number) to go down, they would have to stop mining dogecoin**, but there is 14.4 Dogecoins being produced in one day which is 5 Billion Dogecoin a year.

&#x200B;

* **If you want DogeCoin to be $10** based on the circulating supply we have now, then the **Market Cap would have to be 1.29 Trillion** *(Note: I calculated this several days back, so the number might be even higher now)*, **that's if DOGECOIN STOPPED MINING and NEVER MAKE ANYMORE!**

* **Dogecoin would have to overtake Facebook and Tesla!**

**Once again, this is if Dogecoin stopped mining right now and produced no more Dogecoin supply, but Dogecoin will produce to infinity, it will not stop producing because there is no cap.**

25,Not every new coin is a shitcoin: How to spot the real GEMS inside the sea of shitcoins.,20344,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n9cby0/not_every_new_coin_is_a_shitcoin_how_to_spot_the/,2501,"A few days ago, I made a post titled *""Rugpulls and Honeypots. What they are and how you can avoid them.""* Since then I got a lot of messages from people asking me how they can tell the difference between a new coin with lots of potential and a shitcoin. For maximum protection, make sure you follow this guide in combination with the other guide. I will not repeat those rules here. If you don't follow the rules of the other guide as well, you will lose your money.

Before I start, some background: I trade small coins for a living. In the beginning, while learning, I fell for all the scams just like everyone else. But with every loss I learned something new and I'm now pretty good at it. Yes, I have losses like everyone else, but usually I get out with very small losses compared to my gains.

Anyone here hating shitcoins, I agree with you. **I hate shitcoins too.** Part of what I want to explain here however is that not every new coin is a shitcoin. Every coin has to start with 0 holders. Everyone has to start somewhere. And every solid project deserves a chance to grow. Yes, the vast majority of new coins are shitcoins, but I want to help you tell the difference between the real gems and all the shitcoins.

# The Golden Rules

If you start looking for the real gems and want to trade smaller coins, **follow these rules or you will lose money**. 

1. Start trading on the BSC (Binance) Smart Chain. Why? Transactions cost around $0.20 max. You can't do this on the ETH chain where you spend lots on gas fees, sorry. I know they came down, but they're still too high.
2. For the first 1-2 months, don't invest more than $5 per coin. I am not joking. Yes, your gains will not be thousands of dollars, but if you go in with more you will end up losing a lot of money, trust me.
3. Have a small bag of maybe $150 or $200. Be prepared to lose your small bag completely. If you can't afford this and sleep well at night, don't do it.

**Ready? Let's start:**

# Find the Coins

Go to the BscScan website (look up the links yourself, I don't want to link-spam this post). Then, go to ""View BEP-20 Transfers"". If the list looks confusing, don't worry. Look at the rightmost column that says ""Tokens"". You must look for the grey icon besides the coin names. Why? Because that means the coin is new. Established coins already have their icons listed and that means you're usually too late to make high gains. You can refresh that page for new coins every second, you will always find new ones.

Open the new coins (with the grey icon) in separate tabs and look at them. So, now you have found a coin, it's time to investigate.

# 1. Holders

On the page you just opened, look at the ""Holders"" list. The biggest holders of a coin should always be the liquidity pool which is usually identified as ""PancakeSwap: COIN NAME"" and the dead coins wallet, usually identified as ""0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead"". Why is this important? It reduces the possibility of a rugpull to almost zero, especially if the dead coins wallet is over 50%.

Also watch out if there are too many whales. For example, 10 wallets each holding 3% of total coins is a huge red flag. Abort immediately. A healthy new coin should also have at least 200-300 holders. If it doesn't, also abort immediately.

# 2. Liquidity Pool

The liquidity pool is super important. I usually don't buy any new coin unless the liquidity pool is at least $30k or more. Why? Because scammers and shitcoins rarely provide a liquidity pool of that size. Again, we're greatly reducing our risks here. A locked liquidity pool is also important. Make sure it's locked for a longer period of time. 3 months, 6 months, 1 year or longer are great. You don't want the liquidity pool to unlock tomorrow. You can copy the contract ID and then go to ""PooCoin"" (again, look up the links yourself), then enter the contract URL there, hit enter and on the next page on the left side it will show you something like ""COIN/BNB LP BNB Holdings:"". That's where you want at least $30k or more. If it has a few hundred dollars or even only $5k or $7k, abort immediately.

# 3. Volume

Look at the ""Transfers"" section. If the coin has only 5 holders and no activity, skip it. If you want, bookmark it and come back to check tomorrow. You may have just been too early. If it has only a few transactions every 2-3 hours, also abort immediately. It's not taking off yet. A good number of transactions for a new coin should be about 5-10 per minute.

# 4. Website & Twitter

Make sure the coin has a website and twitter account. If it doesn't have both of them, abort immediately. If it also has a reddit page, a Telegram channel, a Discord, an Instagram page, a YouTube channel, etc. that's even better.

# 5. Coin Name & Design

The logo of the coin and the design of the graphics and website are very important. If it's not attractive, people will not jump in and it won't take off. If the use stock images that you've seen a hundred times elsewhere, abort immediately. The name is also super important. If it has a catchy name like ""Save The World"" it's much more likely to take off than ""Funky Toilet Coin 55"".

# 6. Bonus: Doxxed Team

This one is a HUGE bonus. If the team members publicly identify themselves, for example through YouTube videos or live AMA, it reduces the chance of a scam to almost zero. Why? Because their faces and identities are publicly known and they would almost certainly end up in prison.

# That's it!

Did the coin you investigated fail in any of the first 5 steps? I cannot stress this enough, but: ABORT IMMEDIATELY. Don't invest in it. You will end up losing your money.

Did the coin pass all of the above steps? Great! You ***might*** have found a gem. Do some more research before you jump in and make sure the coin has a real purpose. Remember, things like hodling to get more coins or ""to the moon!"" are not real purposes.

And now we go back to the golden rules. If you are ready to invest in this coin, **remember to only invest $5 for the first 1-2 months** of doing this. I cannot stress this enough. You are learning and you will make mistakes. Make sure you are okay with losing that money because even if a coin matches all of the above, it can still fail for a variety of reasons. If you stick to this rule, you can still make a good amount of money in these 1-2 months. I easily made $10 to $50 with just $5. Sometimes I got out at $3.50 because a coin didn't take off and re-invested elsewhere.

Once you've done the above for 1-2 months and you've noticed any potential mistakes you made, you should be ready to start trading with $10 or $20 per coin (depending on your financial situation).

Two more important things to remember:

1. Early coins take time to take off. It's very possible that your $5 investment will drop to $3 or $2 in that time and go up to $10 and then go back down to $4. It may just sit there doing nothing for 5-14 days. That's absolutely normal.
2. Keep track of what the team is doing during this time. If there are no updates for 2-3 days, sell and get out. A good team should update its holders several times per day through several channels (Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc). It's okay to get only 1 update per day, but less than that is a red flag.

I **always** follow the above rules when trading with small coins and I currently have success with 90-95% of coins that I invest in. Trust me, **I tried to skip some of the rules above and I got burned every time**. Yes, it's a lot of work. Especially if you have to repeat these steps for every single coin you want to investigate, but you will get much faster at it over time. If you end up doing this for a living, you will probably be able to investigate 2-3 coins per minute.

Now, if you excuse me, I need a coffee and relax my fingers a bit. They hurt :P",2021-05-10 18:29:24
26,"If someone is screaming ""Hold The Line"" they really mean ""Prop up the price so I can get out too""",20316,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n8h7ky/if_someone_is_screaming_hold_the_line_they_really/,1539,"As the title really. If someone is screaming at you and calling you out for selling they are not doing this because they are worried about your gains. They are worried about their own, they bought high and need the price up to recoup their losses.

Someone in profit quietly takes their gains and walks away, or quietly rides it out.

Someone who believes in the project will ride it out too, they will understand you taking profits, they will be confident someone else will buy in. They will generally behave in an encouraging manner.

People doing the shouting are usually bag holders, this all may be obvious to most of you, but for some, particularly when it is ""your coin"" it is hard to see.

Take a step back and look objectively at it as if it were another coin, think about how you would feel looking from the outside.

A community that berates you for selling when you want to is toxic and should be a red flag.

Take care out there people",2021-05-09 16:03:05

People need an asset that they know can't be arbitrarily printed or controlled by corrupt governments.

And after 12 years, this narrative is taking hold. The financial industry is starting to take Bitcoin seriously, investors and large corporations are putting Bitcoin on their balance sheet to reduce their dependency on the behavior of the US federal government.

**But the next fight is upon us.**

This week, the common folk of the internet discovered their power. They discovered that by working together, they can challenge the powerful entities of Wall Street.

And Wall Street hates it.

As of right now, Robinhood and most other trading products are in ""reduce only mode"".

Wall Street has decided that you're not responsible enough to buy the stocks that you like, so they've taken away your stock buying privileges.

Of course, hedge funds will still have access to GME and AMC. But not you.

**This is why Bitcoin is only the beginning of this revolution.**

It's not simply enough to be able to custody your own assets. You need to be able to trade them, to lend them, to leverage them. You should have access to the same financial instruments that the rich people on Wall Street have access to.

**This is why we need DeFi**

Nobody can turn off Uniswap. Nobody can turn off Aave. Nobody can turn off Synthetix.

Nobody can tell you that leverage-longing some shitcoin is irresponsible and you're not allowed to do it.

**This can be our moment.**

Thousands of people, from WSB to Twitter, have just been deplatformed, just for wanting to invest their money as they see fit.

While I have your attention, I want to take 5 seconds of your time and bring some exposure to something that is threatening our existence as the human race. If you aren't interested, please skip down to the main article. I'm talking about finding a way to live sustainably on this planet, regenerative agriculture, where we get our food from, and how we can make sure that our kids and grandkids have something left once we leave. 

Please consider reading up on Permaculture, sustainable living, Forest gardening, Backyard Chickens, etc. Consider following what I did and do it for yourself. [This all used to be a useless lawn.](https://youtu.be/U79bql-JSqI)

[Bored for a night? Go watch ""Sustainable"" on Netflix.](https://sustainablefoodfilm.com/) 

Look into people like [Geoff Lawton](http://www.geofflawtononline.com/), Mark Shepard, Sepp Holzer, these people are going to save us. 

Want to make a small change yourself? Grow a tomato plant on your balcony in a pot. Reduce transport of the tomatoes you eat, and make ~$50 per plant in saved money. Want to do something bigger? Plant a fruit tree in your backyard. Maybe two. Maybe a raspberry bush. You are now part of saving the human race.

If everyone reading this planted a fruit tree, or even some wild flowers, we could save the bees.

While you are at it, planting a fruit tree has been shown to be one of the best investments on the planet. There's pretty much no investment on the planet that is more financially lucrative (while still being nearly bullet-proof safe) than planting a fruit tree.

You can get a tree at an end of sale auction for literally 5-10 bucks, and that tree will produce THOUSANDS of dollars of fruit for you in it's lifetime. Go spend $200 bucks at an end of season sale, plant 10-20 trees (if you have room), and that $200 will be worth tens of thousands of dollars of saved money.

Do it right, [set it up right and it's almost no work](https://youtu.be/bjBLVSo0zeY) because you offload the work to nature - as it has done for the last few billion years. Go learn how, let me show you how. If you do it right, it's zero work after you have planted and wood-chipped, and all you do is pull dollars off a tree.

**I also expended the ""now what happens"" section, to explain how these pullbacks are a good thing, make crypto more stable, and why we keep seeing larger ceilings after every pullback... this stuff is really important for you to make money on this thing, if that's your goal....**

I've made a similar post in a few spots, and this is something that is absolutely critical for people to understand... what impacts price, and what is going on lately. Price has only a very minor correlation with money invested, and a major correlation with opinion. 

... and Humans are an emotional bunch.

So what drives price of any commodity, crypto, gold, pizzas, whatever? The money invested in it, right? Kind of, but not really. What if I told you that you could theoretically raise bitcoin from $15k to $20k by spending $1, and lower it from $25k to $1k by spending the same $1? Crazy right?

**AN EXAMPLE**

This is going to start out slow, I want to make sure I get everyone on the same page before I pick things up and lift the curtain. Stick with me here....

This is an example to help illustrate why prices aren't driven by money invested, but rather consensus and opinion. Lets imagine the following exists (we will use bitcoin as an example, but this is how everything on the planet works)

Lets say Bitcoin is currently priced at $10k (the last sale). From $11k to $99k, every $1k there is someone with a sell order of 1 full bitcoin. From $9k to $1 dollar, every $1k on the way down there is someone with a buy order of 1 full bitcoin.

So, right now if you wanted to buy bitcoin you have several options... meet the lowest seller's price of $11k, or, put your own buy order up, above the highest buyer's bid order (overcut them). If you decide to just place an order, the price doesn't change. If you decide the buy the $11k bitcoin, now bitcoins value is $11k, with a new lowest sell offer of $12k, and a highest buy bid of $10k. Someone else comes in an overcuts the buy bid and puts 1 BTC for sale for $11k. No trades are made until someone matches a buy/sell.

Okay, that's kindergarten stuff, most people here understand that. So how much money drove the price up in this situation? $11k, and BTC price raised 11/10, 1.10, or 10% from the last sale. Now the entire marketcap of BTC raised 10% (last sale multiplied by circulating supply). So it takes $11k to drive a 10% increase, right? Not at all. Lets look at what happens when news is released.

News comes out that Warren Buffet thinks bitcoin is a scam, a bubble, and he wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because he only invests in things he understands and he doesn't understand crypto. People panic everywhere, and believe ""this guy is smart, I'm overvaluing this thing"".

Suddenly people don't want to buy this scam anymore, and the buy orders for $11k, $10, and $9k are taken down. 

At the same time, the people wanting to sell start to panic and just want out. The guy at $32k (who just had that offer up ""just incase it moons"") drops down to $11k sell order. The guy at $12k, who was the lowest, now undercuts him to $10k. 

The other buyers see the sellers undercutting and think that if these people want out, why am I buying in. The $8k guy pulls his offer, and so do the $7k, $6k and $5k guys. The highest offer is now $4k. 

The sellers panic further and the $14k guy undercuts the $10k guy and puts up a $9k sell. The $15k, 17k and 11k guys all see this flurry of panic and now a storm undercutting is triggered, to $8k, $7k, and $6k. The $8k order pulls his again and goes down to $5k. 

The price on the buy and sell orders has moved around a ton, but no sales have actually happened yet. Technically, BTC is still ""worth"" $11k, and the market cap reflects that. All this horseshit has happened, and it only happened in 10 seconds, but the price hasn't moved yet. 

The $27k guy wakes up and checks his phone. He had a $27k offer just incase the price moved also, and he also only has a tiny infinitesimal fraction of a BTC. Well, he decides ""he's out"" and fills $1 worth of the part of the $4k guys buy offer.

The latest price information is now updated, and BTC fell from $11k to $4k price per BTC with the movement of a single dollar.

This is exaggerated example, but this is what moves price. Not money in vs money out. The ONLY THING that moves price is perception.

**OPINION FLOW AND NOT MONEY FLOW**

Now the above example only happens if everyone simultaneously believe the same thing... this the asset they are holding is a steaming turd. What happens in reality is there's no black and white, it's shades of gray. It's flow in vs flow out. But again, not flow MONEY, but rather OPINIONS.

If 66% of the holders of something all of a sudden unanimously decide that their asset is overvalued, then they panic sell. Even if 33% of the people decide they are going to buy up as much as these panic sellers sell, if the panic is strong enough, and they are slitting eachother's throat to sell, then the buyers just happily sit and let them do that, and time their buys in. Very little money has to actually change hands in order for this price to crash, all that matters is the FLOW OF OPINION has to be swift and violent, and in majority. The sellers will leapfrog eachother on the way down, faster than the buyers scoop up their sales, and the net result is a crashed price.

Note, this happens both ways... fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) as well as overhyped FOMO (Fear of missing out). 

**So now what happens?**

Time goes by and all holders opinions of their asset hasn't changed. They still think it's worth $11k and they got great deals scooping up what these sellers were selling. The weak hands have left the market and have been replaced with holders. Overall, now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding and are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week. Panic sellers were also replaced by new money, people who have wanted in for a while and are now in on their perceived ground floor.

Also, people who bought BTC at $1 ten years ago and have been looking for an exit to cash profits have now been replaced by either long term holders, or by these new people who are thrilled to have finally entered, and they are looking to hold long. 

So what happens on pullbacks? The number of people waiting to jump off the ship has decreased. The new ground floor is established. Are we done? Who knows, this could go on for another year, but what matters is that people who want off are getting off and people that want on are getting on. 

People who have panic sold and never believed in this in the firstplace... people who have wanted out for 10 years... they have been replaced by people who are now getting in on THEIR GROUND FLOOR, and are going to be holding long. The market is suddenly increasingly more stable today than it was yesterday, even though prices are down. 

**This is a good thing.** This is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. Old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone. They are replaced with adopters, holders, believers in this technology. These people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. Every crash brings more of these people in, and removes more panic sellers out. 

**Moving forward**

Now news releases start coming out about how stock ETFs are being created, NASDAQ index funds, bank support, government support. Companies are using this tech, and companies who use blockchain for transportation are putting non-blockchain companies out of business. 

The people on the outside looking-in feel they are missing out. They now start coming in and buying. They start overpricing eachother on their buy orders, and eventually it gets close enough to a sell order that someone decides they are just going to meet the sell price. The sale goes through.

Sellers (HODLERs) see this action, and they start pulling sell orders off the table almost as fast as they fill. Sure some trades go through, and incoming money is driving the price up as market orders are filled. But what's also happening is people are seeing this flurry of volume, and sellers are pulling sell orders and placing them higher. 

Junk coins and pump and dump scam coins are dying by the millions. In their ashes, good solid technology projects whose coins have fundamental economic reasons for growth, these are rising. Corporate partnerships continue forming. The real world continues to create actual use cases. Companies start storing more and more corporate information on blockchain. Public companies use blockchain to store scientific research (See Canadian Research Council announcements), and blockchain acts as a Library of Alexandria. People can travel out of country without any monetary exchange, using their chosen cryptocurrency to buy the things they need abroad. The world is slowly actually USING this technology. 

Money is coming in, but more importantly, OPINION IS CHANGING. Literally nothing could have happened in terms of fundamentals, partnerships, etc... this can all be driven entirely emotional, so long as it's wide-spread and strong. Infact, the market could THEORETICALLY rebound in this way from $4000/BTC to $1 MILLION PER BITCOIN by the sale of ONE PENNY. $4000 sound low? Does that number make you uncomfortable? We may go that low. We may not. If we do, I'm not panicking and selling, I'm buying more.


**SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS? and where are we going?**

A lot of new money has come in from Nov-Jan, and they don't really know what they are investing in. Sure some of them have done great research and are smart investors but most people aren't and isntead they are buying Symbols and Names and trading on speculation. They are treating their favorite coins like a sports team, and will follow them irrationally off a cliff.

These new people came in and invested in cryptocurrency because their OPINION was heavily influenced in Nov, Dec, Jan, from media. They saw this money making machine called crypto. They were willing to pay huge, ride the wave up, keep buying, etc. They were ""ground floor adopters"" and were going to get rich.

They outnumber the old money by A LOT. Their OPINION MATTERS. It matters the most.

To keep this in perspective, they are also a VAST MINORITY of ""new money"" that will enter the game in the next decade. This cycle will continue over and over and over. 

Their opinion rose nearly unbounded and price rose accordingly. Market cap rose from 10B to 750B, and it could have been VERY LITTLE actual money that did this. How much did it need to be though? Literally ONE PENNY, theoretically. All that matters in moving price is MOMENTUM OF OPINION. I believe it has been estimated that as low as 6B USD was responsible for the bull rush.

These people then started hearing ""Bubble"", ""Scam"", Fake news about governments banning. They don't understand how technology wins, always. Crypto is beyond government control. If they could have stopped Bitcoin they would have done it already. 

**WHO IS DRIVING ALL THIS?**

Most investment opportunities go first to ""accredited investors"". You need to have multimillions in order to get in on the ground floor for most stock IPOs, and we're seeing that start to happen with coin ICOs. Bitcoin was a joke for the first few years, while lunatics picked it up. At this point, it was really too late to get in ""early"", and who would have wanted to anyways, it was all still a joke. So Wallstreet, banks, governments have generally watched on the sidelines as average Joes who were crazy enough to be early adopters and toss $100 on fake internet money slowly became millionaires. 

Not only that, but the idea of blockchain started to become understood. The power and value in it became understood. Not only as a way to track ""monetary value"" but for many other applications as well. Platforms were created, business uses brainstormed, products started being made. This thing started taking off, and wasn't a joke anymore. But regardless, big money wasn't in on the ground floor. They have stakeholders opinions to think of, and what do they say to investors when they lose all their money on magic internet points?

But they have woken up now. This thing has ""popped"" many times now and keeps recovering. This thing won't die. could they have been wrong all along? If they want in, how do they get in? They are no dummies, they have been controlling the world their whole lives? Look at the media experiment that Trump is doing? He is testing just how we work... you can do literally anything and we remember it for like 30 seconds, until the next news story comes out. We change opinions very easily. We are swayed very easily. We are their puppets. Media controls the world. They know their way in.

They have ONE WEAPON against cryptocurrency.

YOUR OPINION OF IT.

And they know it.

**Media.**

That's why FUD is so powerful and needs to be respected. It's why we need to read more than titles on news articles. We need to question what we read, **whether it's good news or bad news**. We need to think about ""what are the motives of the person saying this to me"". Does the government have a conflict of interest when they state that crypto is gambling? Do they have skin in the game? 

What about wall street? Does WEISS ratings possibly have incentive to come out with poor ratings? Do banks have incentive to lock accounts in order to ""protect"" customers from ""unsafe investments"" when their entire business model revolves around holding as much of your money as possible and making money off it? Do you think banks have any super secret hidden interest in preventing you from storing your money elsewhere? I'm not sure, maybe you can critically think about that.

Just understand that this goes both ways. When crypto is booming and Fox news is showing people how to buy $4 ripple on prime time, you may want to start putting in some stop loss orders. When the suicide hotline is stickied at the top of /r/cryptocurrency and everyone is panic selling, you may want to start picking up some firesale deals. 

So, the question is this... Is crypto undervalued or overvalued at it's price today? Where is the price going long term? **I'm not talking about it's use case**, I'm talking about in the **court of public opinion**, where is THAT going? Because THAT is what is going to drive price in the future.

Without a crystal ball, this is of course impossible to know. Do your own research and form your own opinion. It could very well be that the technology having a use-case will in and of itself drive opinion, and thus price. But make sure you understand that it's not the technology itself, it's not the value of the business itself, it's not the use case itself that will drive price, it is the publics OPINION of that thing which drives price. They are intertwined, but they are NOT the same thing.

TLDR: VERY VERY little money has to move around in order to swing prices drastically, up or down. Money in and out doesn't drive price, OPINION does. How do you let the news you read impact your opinion?How are you being played (on both sides, shilling and FUD).

Something is only worth what people think it's worth. Often that's based on reality, value, business, money, but often it's entirely emotional.

[Structure your portfolio in a balance, intelligent way, using risk methodology.](https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptocurrency-investment-risk-management/). Invest money you are willing to lose. Support legitimate technology and teams who are actively driving their product to completion, coding, and marketing. Stop trying to make money overnight in pump and dump scams, or pyramid schemes. 

Every day, take one coin, do a deep dive on it, learn it inside and out. Look into their team and their past. Do that every day for a year, and you just learned 365 coins inside and out. Ask yourself the following key questions:

Have those members consistently jumped ship on previous projects? Is that where you want to invest in? Is their team capable of executing on their vision? Are they trying to solve world hunger, and their team is a few 16 year olds in a garage? How active is their github? Are they adding chunks of code regularly, or is a ghost town? Are they marketing their product at all? Or is marketing the only thing they are doing? 

What are the economics of their coin itself? Is it required to be used to gain access to their technology? Are there burns? How premined is it, and what portion do the founders hold? 

What about their vision? Are they trying to solve a problem that needs to be solved? What are the economics of that problem and how much money does the solution potentially save clients?

These are all questions you should be asking when you give your money to someone else. We're a lot more stable than we were - a correction was bound to happen. Too much early money wanted to cash in profits. These people have been replaced by new money who is holding on their own ground floor. The whole industry in general is still in very early stages. Rest assured that anyone reading this is still very much an early adopter. Just make sure you are investing in actual technology, and supporting capable teams, and not buying air. Buy the Googles and Amazons of Crypto, not the pets.com or flooz.com of cryptos.

Happy investing everyone.

> In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. **As part of the policy, which was duly approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets**, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt. **We believe our bitcoin holdings are highly liquid. However, digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices, which may be unfavorable at the time when we want or need to liquidate them.**

43,Pornhub just saved a lot of my crypto,18713,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nwogjt/pornhub_just_saved_a_lot_of_my_crypto/,1813,"So about 20 minutes ago, I got a ""hey, did you fly to Germany overnight?"" Unauthorized login email from pornhub. Checked it, sure enough someone logged in with my password. Don't give two shits about someone watching porn on my account, so I immediately went to work on the rest.

I don't share passwords with any accounts, but pornhub one was an oddly secure password that probably couldn't be brute forced... I assumed breach.

Changed all my exchange passwords that were tied to the same email, and switched all their 2fa to my phone instead of email. That's when I start getting login failure notices... Of course they hit the exchanges first.

After that I damage controlled financial institution accounts, and sure enough started seeing login failures on those. About 15 minutes after I got the pornhub notice (when serious damage would've already been done) I got a ""possible breach"" notification from capital one assistant.

I totally am usually asleep right now. Pornhub may have just saved me tens of thousands of dollars, and is apparently more reliable than all my financial institutions.

****Update and FAQ:

Thanks so much for the awards and responses! I just thought this was a funny near miss and wanted to share my maniacal laughter, had no idea it would blow up like this.

So, turns out it was my phone that was malware compromised. Factory reset, extended authy to everything for now, all passwords changed, all financial institutions alerted.

As has been pointed out a few times in comments, it's likely they accessed pornhub first because if I had linked crypto wallets or bank accounts for tipping, they could just send all meh money to their verified account. Probably a super easy front door way of scooping a couple BTC up from unwitting peoples... Hadn't thought of that, I just assumed they were testing access.

No, having a pornhub account doesn't mean I pay for porn, just that I like to save playlists and favorites. Some of you are living in the 90s of internet porn. 

Amazed at how many people assume that the breach came from pornhub. Frankly, it seems like they guard info better than anyone else I deal with. I would never think of putting personal information into any porn site... Pornhub's app has always proven to be secure and well supported.

All credit accounts frozen, all financial institutions contacted. Net loss of ZERO. They attempted a $7000 wire transfer out of my checking account that my small town bank ofc called me about, and a $1300 credit card purchase that got declined as sketch. Otherwise it seems I beat them to all accounts.

****EDIT 2:

Since so many people are asking about my phone... It's an Android, brand new Motorola sealed in box. No, I don't know the source, just know that it happened in a 2 hour window before I got all my security up and running, during which time I used it for work a lot and downloaded a lot of my standard programs.

I just ran my basic security check, and thing came up red af, so I didn't even bother trying to treat... I only have had it for a week, reset was easy.",2021-06-10 14:04:59

We wondered what it would be like. We have been asking ourselves that question since 2016 and possibly even earlier. Well...

Here is your answer. This is how the market looks like when we start to see a tiny bit of mass adoption.

Billionaires are manipulating the market? It's a part of the mass adoption game we have to accept. There are ways to resist it, but you can't just say ""Please Elton go home and shut up"" because guess what, Elton won't go home and shut up. 

You can't ban anyone from coming into this space, that's the whole point of fucking decentralization. You can't ban a billionaire from participating in the same way you can't ban a school teacher from participating.

You want to complain about people buying doggy coins? Same shit. Tough luck that your coin is only seeing 1000% growth and not 10,000% boo. Again, you can resist your FOMO and you can invest smartly into fundamentals, but you cannot ban people from spending their money. It's their money and you're not HSBC. No matter how much you wish for it, you can't ban people from buying Bitconnect or Cumdoggy coins or whatever, they'll learn from their experience and that's how the market will correct it self.

Rejoice crypto hodlers.

Suddenly in April of 2019 Tether claimed only 74% of Tether would be backed by ""cash and *cash equivalents*""

* **Sir Philip and Lady Green went on a property spree** after off-loading the BHS retail chain which went on to collapse

""The leak shows that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, singer Shakira and many other familiar faces engaged in, at best, aggressive tax avoidance that was accomplished by hiding assets in extremely complex corporate legal entities. Though in some cases hidden funds seem linked to outright corruption, much of this activity is nominally legal – but the very existence of such structures almost guarantees they’re being used for deeply harmful ends well beyond dodging taxes.

For those in the crypto world, it is tempting to frame these revelations in terms of simple “whataboutism.” And hooboy, what about this: By one estimate, as much as **$32 trillion in assets worldwide** **may be in offshore tax havens. That’s roughly** ***15 times the total value of all cryptocurrency in existence***\*\*,\*\* and much of it amounts to theft by world leaders from their own citizens. The tax revenues missing thanks to those hidden funds mean immense amounts of missing public infrastructure and services worldwide, at the particular expense of the poorest and most vulnerable people.

There are many nuanced, detailed arguments for the inevitability of cryptocurrency and blockchain’s growth and adoption – advantages of efficiency, trust, privacy and autonomy that are already proving out at a global scale.

But interest in cryptocurrency is driven perhaps most of all by something more elemental and emotional, a deep intuition that has been rising around the world for decades: **that the people in charge cannot, and should not, be trusted.""**

Hillary Clinton recently stated that: ""What looks like a very interesting and somewhat exotic effort to literally mine new coins in order to trade with them **has the potential for undermining currencies, for undermining the role of the dollar as the reserve currency, for destabilizing nations""** and she is completely right, that is the idea of cryptocurrencies in the 21st century, **to deconstruct a corrupt financial system and provide a more decentralized, better version of it.**

65,Elon Musk Just Embarrassed Himself In Front Of Crypto Twitter,16837,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ndedgf/elon_musk_just_embarrassed_himself_in_front_of/,3587,"[Elon Musk Tweet](https://ibb.co/dBSg5ps)

On the Night of May 15th, a Twitter profile tweeted Doge Coin is the chosen one by Elon Musk because of its lower fees and less environmental effect.

Elon Musk replies that he wants to speed up Block time 10X and increase Block size 10X to reduce transaction fee 100X, for Doge Coin. 

If the solution of blockchain scaling was simply to change the variables, why Adam Beck didn't think of this and why Satoshi didn't think of this.

Even now projects like Ethereum can increase the limit and make transaction fees on the chain reduce over 1000X.

THE SOLUTION IS NOT TO JUST CHANGE NUMBERS.

It seriously has a bad effects on the network security and decentralization. (Please remember this)

Many projects like BCH and BSV has tried all this. And failed.

This narrative is so 2013.

Bitcoin has proven itself again and again over the years on why it is the King. And projects like Ethereum are working for years to scale in this perspective. 

If you are new to crypto, please do not get manipulated by Elon Musk's tweets. 

IMO, Doge Coin is just a tool for Elon to flex his dominance around this space. It won't last long as he clearly has no clue what he is talking about.",2021-05-16 02:22:21
66,Bill Gates said “The way cryptocurrency works today allows for certain criminal activities. It’d be good to get rid of that”. Crypto was not used to launder money according to Pandora papers. Its time for these people to swallow their words and be critical of traditional finance and the government.,16593,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q1tgui/bill_gates_said_the_way_cryptocurrency_works/,2227,"Pandora papers showed that people are using loopholes in tax laws to hide their wealth in tax havens to hide their wealth or ill gotten gains. They are not using cryptocurrency to do that, there are plenty of loopholes in tax laws for doing it legally.

The rich are holding properties and investments under a network of offshore companies that are set up in other countries, or ""offshore"".

These offshore countries or territories are where:

\- it's easy to set up companies

\- there are laws that make it difficult to identify owners of companies

\- there is low or no corporation tax.

The best part of it is that using tax havens to dodge taxes is not illegal. Loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by  moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is  often seen as unethical.

Its estimated that from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion is hidden in tax havens, according to the ICIJ.  The IMF has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year.

To hide money all you need to do set up a shell company in one of the countries or  jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists  in name only, with no staff or office.  It costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell  companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names  of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately  behind the business.

When such a huge amount of money is hidden in offshore havens, the rich still blames cryptocurrency as the culprit for money laundering. This is classic gaslighting. They are projecting and blaming the most vulnerable group, what they do themselves.

This legal way of tax dodging will never end because the people that could end the secrecy offshore are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it.

Its time more people speak up against this and move more towards cryptocurrency where all data is independently verifiable.




EDIT 1: It was a mistake on my part to say crypto is not used for money laundering. I saw that Bill Gates mentioned cryptocurrency as an innovation that the world can do without because it is sometimes used for criminal activities and with the current pandora papers leak where the ultra rich was dodging taxes using tax havens and trusts and thought , here is a guy doing borderline unethical things to dodge taxes and is bad mouthing a nascent technology because it is used for criminal activities by a small section of people taking advantage of its use cases. He was saying the world doesn't need crypto without seeing it's far reaching positive sides. 


I thought if a few criminal activities makes him think that crypto should be stopped, why doesn't he say the same thing about the banks, law firms and other institutions that promote, support and enrich from tax dodging. That's why I made the post.
I am sorry I made the mistake in the headline, it was unintentional. 

I didn't expect the post will blow up or will be seen by more than a couple of people. Sorry again.",2021-10-05 10:19:05

Set up your own business, study something you love or whatever. Just make sure your brain will keep doing some exercise and that you'll be part of some group/society.

Seeing so many posts about when lambo, when moon etc., I see myself a few years ago discovering that I could finally hasten by \~10 years my retirement (I'm in my 60's now). Damn, was I happy about that. I could finally erase all my debt, travel without worrying about days off being discounted of my paycheck, spend lots of time with my family and buy some of the stuff I've always wanted. In \~6 months my life changed really hard, and for the better! I gave my grand kids a nice trip do Disney and paid the wedding of my youngest daughter. Suddenly everything fit perfectly.

After 7-8 months, then, I got myself thinking like ""so... is this it?"". I was not happy anymore. Don't get me wrong: I wasn't *unhappy*, but I wasn't happy either. I would wake up everyday, go for a walk, pass by some bakery and buy some stuff, and get back home to surf on the web. I could of course travel to wherever I wanted, but what for? 

Friends came in asking for money and I never heard from them again. Some relatives thought I'd won the lottery and suddenly became extremely friendly and helpful, even though literally no one but my daughter and her husband were here at my wife's funeral. 

At the end, I've decided to go back to studying and finally entered college. It changed my way of perceiving the world and now I'm quite happy. I've also volunteered at some NGOs in my city and it helped me to keep my pace with society.

So my advice is that you need to get prepared to deal with boredom. We grow up with our parents telling us to go to school, have a job, a car, a house and that this is life. But when you suddenly have the car, the house and everything else, what's left? Do something for yourself and have this in mind. 

Boredom hits hard and you need to get prepared to deal with it.

Godspeed to you all!

John claimed he was too 'busy' to invest, i.e. playing video games all day and jacking off in his uni dorm room.

However, recently, John had a change of heart. he wanted to pull himself together and thought that crypto would be the catalyst so he came to me to learn. naturally i was ecstatic, this was one of my best friends and i really enjoy teaching people things. I taught John everything i knew, how to use exchanges, how to set up a wallet, how to spot good projects, the trends of the market etc.. i spent countless hours of my personal time helping him learn basic things (he is a bit slow).

Now, i warned John to steer clear of shitcoins. i told him that although you may get lucky and get rich quick, the chance of this happening is so low and newbies like him fall victim to these scams the most. he was very off put by this and assured me he would avoid them.

A few weeks go buy and i received a very long message from John. He told me he was quitting crypto and he had lost all of his savings he put in. i was shocked, but as i read the message it became clear to me what had happened. he said a youtuber had basically shilled him a 'low market cap' coin telling him he could 50x his money in a week. Yes, John fell victim to a pump and dump.

This is where it gets worse, i replied asking why would he do this when i advised him otherwise. i got no message back, i called him a few days after and to my shock the phone would instantly hang up. John blocked me on everything, not just phone but instagram, whatsapp, facebook. i was shocked and upset, i had done nothing wrong. i asked one of our mutual friends if i could speak to John, and he told me that John wanted nothing to do with me because i had made him lose all his money,

He didnt blame himself, or even the scammy youtuber, he blamed the person who introduced him to crypto and **warned** him of scams.

It really hurts writing this knowing ive lost someone i knew for 10 years over something i didn't even do. i just tried to help.

The moral of the story is don't advise people to get into crypto, or tell them what to invest in, friends or even family, because when shit goes south the first person they will blame is you.

79,Will DOGE be worth $100 a coin? Can it become as big as ETH? Could Stellar Lumens be worth $1000 a coin? Will Safemoon make me rich?? We all need to look at total supply vs market cap to manage our expectations and be more logical about what is possible.,15386,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n5wkwq/will_doge_be_worth_100_a_coin_can_it_become_as/,3171,"The answer to all of those lofty expectations? Impossible. This is a mistake a lot of people are making. You have to look at total supply and multiply it by price per coin to get the market cap. Let’s look at a few popular ones…

Bitcoin is rare like gold, difficult to mine like gold and is used as a store of value like gold. As it becomes more scarce, it will continue to rise in price. It has a total supply of 21 million, of which 18 million are already circulating. After the 21 million are mined, there will be no more available. 18 million x $57k means it has a market cap of over a trillion dollars. That is huge. The total market cap for ALL crypto is 2.38 trillion. Bitcoin is king. Bigger than Visa and MasterCard combined. Bigger than nearly every world bank. It is the world’s 3rd largest currency. 

Ethereum has a total supply of 115 million. More coins than Bitcoin. At the moment, it allows for 18 million to be mined each year max. In July, they are making a change with the London Hardfork, EIP 1559, and every time a transaction is made with ETH, the ETH fees will be burned, making the supply more limited and much more valuable, similar to BTC. Many are saying that ETH will go up to $10k per coin this year because of these changes. When ETH 2.0 is released next year, the price will probably go much higher. With 115 million in circulation, ETH has a market cap of $400 billion. That’s worth more than all of Walmart. 

So, it is really important to check the coin supply and then multiply that by the price you wish it would go to to make you rich. See if the amount seems realistic or not. 

Let’s look at DOGE. Doge has a total supply of 127 billion coins and a max of 10,000 are mined each day [EDIT: DOGE mints 10,000
coins every *minute*, not every day!]. That’s an additional 5 billion coins each year. If you multiply 127 billion coins the $100 you wish it were per coin, it would have a market cap of $12.7 trillion dollars. There is $37 trillion dollars in the world. Is DOGE worth 1/3 of all the money in the world? The entire economy of the United States is $25.3 trillion. Is it realistic to say a meme coin is worth roughly half the US economy…the largest economy in the world?

Let’s take a look at Stellar Lumens. The max supply is $50 billion. The supply increase is 500 million a year, which alone is 23 times the total amount of BTC each year. Anyway, if it were $1000 per coin, the total market cap would be $50 trillion, more than double the US economy. At the very most, maybe they could be $10 each? I say it could be worth $10 because it has actual utility. I think DOGE would top out at $1, and that would be pretty crazy. 

If DOGE were worth as much as ETH, which I’ve seen people on the doge subreddit think might happen, Doge would be worth a modest $388,720,000,000,000. $388 trillion. That’s at least 3 times all the money in the world economy, if Google serves me right.

Then you have to be really careful of coins that are just a rug pull and get promoted on Tik-Tok, like Safemoon. I don’t even need to do the math on Safemoon to know it’s a scam. They will get people to throw all their money into it and then they cash out their supply and take everyone’s money. The total supply for Safemoon is 1 quadrillion coins!!! Stay away from that. Insanity. 

Look at supply of successful coins beyond BTC and ETH and see if you think they could be worth a lot more in the future. Here are some I think worth investing in:

Polkadot (DOT): Total supply: 935.5 million, total supply 1 billion

Chainlink (LINK): Total supply: 419 million, max 1 billion

Cardano (ADA): Total supply: 45 billion. This coin has many great uses, but will not be worth as much as others simply because of the number of circulating coins. Maybe $10-$12 a coin max? But it is under $2 right now. 

ATOM: Total supply: 248 million. New coins are created each year as rewards for people that hold (stake) ATOM. If you can find a good coin that gives you APR, many are 5-6%…much better than a traditional savings account! 

Algorand (ALGO): 2.96 billion, also releases new coins as rewards to people that hold ALGO. 

Tezos (XTZ), circulating supply: 756 million. Total supply: 763 million. 

MANA: this coin is only used for a video game called Decentraland. Atari is making a casino opening in May in that virtual world. Supply available: 1.5 billion. Total supply: 2.6 billion. 

Polygon (MATIC): 10 billion, half in circulation. Because there is a max supply of 10 billion, if it grew to the size of ETH…which won’t happen…each coin would be worth $35 a coin (Take the market cap of ETH and divide it by the supply of MATIC to see what it would be if it were as huge as ETH). It’s under a dollar now. Maybe it could grow to 1/4 of ETH if we’re being optimistic? That would put it at $8.75 a coin. 

Enjin (ENJ) 1 billion coins max, 834 million circulating. 

The list goes on, I just picked a handful of random coins I hear mentioned a lot, but all you need to do to check out what a realistic expectation for a coin is is to take the current supply of tokens, multiply it by what you wish the coin was worth and compare the market cap to BTC or ETH’s market cap, over a trillion and $400 billion, respectively. I don’t expect any alt coin to be worth as much as those those two. And, it bears repeating, the entire cryptocurrency market is worth 2.38 trillion. If you calculate that your coin at $100 is going to be worth double, triple, or quadruple that, I’d say that’s an impossibility. Likewise, you can do the math the other way to see what your coin would be worth per coin if it were as big as ETH or BTC by simply dividing the market cap for ETH or BTC by the number of coins circulating for your prospective coin. Your coin won’t grow as big as those two, but it’s a good way to visualize it and manage your expectations.

This goes for miners too as there were these 14 year old kids in the news recently for making 30k a month.

It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)\*:** Bitcoin Scam Variant
18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.
39. **FTX Token (FTT):** It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.
40. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the token of Crypto.com public blockchain, that tries to enable transaction worldwide between people and businesses.
41. **Filecoin (FIL):** a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services.
42. **UMA (UMA):** it builds open-source infrastructure in order to create synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",2021-02-09 12:03:25

We've seen a peak bubble at around 850 billion total market cap in the first week of January, consolidated down to $750 billion and have now just experienced a 40% correction. 

#What's happening now and how bad will it get?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all you should realize that there is a [January Dip that happens every year, when we see a roughly 20-30% decline around mid January](https://i.imgur.com/VXEHw0W.png). This year its been much more severe though for several additional factors that have compounded on top.

Different theories exist on why this happens (its actually the mirror opposite of the ""January Effect"" that happens in the US stock market), but the two major theories are:

1) Asian markets pull into fiat because of Asian New Year spending needs

2) People in the US sell in January to defer their capital gains tax liability an extra year

While this cyclic event has lead to a healthy correction in the last few years, this year we got these new factors making more fear as well:

* [Yet more scary news on China cracking down on crypto exchanges](http://www.coindesk.com/pboc-official-calls-for-wider-ban-on-chinese-crypto-trading-report/)

* [Korea regulatory uncertainty](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/cryptocurrencies-resume-slide-as-bitcoin-tumbles-to-december-low)

* [European governments talking about regulations](http://news.yahoo.com/rule-bitcoin-must-global-germanys-central-bank-says-154144224--business.html)

* [BTC futures contracts are now expiring this week](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_settlements_futures.html), and possible manipulation there with contract hedging pushing the price down

* Bitconnect Ponzi finally collapses

* We had a new breed of speculators come in during the November/December timeframe after media made cryptocurrency mainstream following the Bitcoin 10K landmark. While cryptocurrency markets have always had too much hype, the latest rise wasn't just over-enthusiasm in fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies like Monero and Ethereum, but mass inflows of fiat into vaporware and complete nonsense without any use case. Many people came in to essentially gamble on symbols on an exchange, and are thus short term oriented and quick to sell on any slight downturn, which such further adds to selling pressure.

So in essence we got a storm of scary news along with the usual cyclic downturn. Currently I don't see this as being a systematic crash like Mt.Gox was that would lead to a long term bear market because the fundamental ecosystem is still intact, and I suspect that after about a month we should consolidate around a new low. All the exchanges are still operational and liquid, and there is no breakdown in trust nor uncertainty whether you'll be able to cash out. What range the market trades in will all depend how Bitcoin does, right now we've already broken below 10K but I'm seeing a lot of support at around $8000, which is [roughly where the long term MA curve settles](https://i.imgur.com/kKVsoUt.png). We don't know how bad it will get or what the future will bring, but as of right now we shouldn't be in a bear market yet.

**What should you do if you recently entered the market?**

If you did buy in the last few months at or near ATH, the very worst thing you can do now is sell in panic and lose your principal. You shouldn't have more money in crypto than you can afford to lose, so it shouldn't be a problem to wait. You have to realize that 30% corrections in crypto are relatively common, just last fall we had a 40% flash correction over more China fears. Unless there is a systematic breakdown like we had during Mt.Gox, the market always recovers. 

The other worst thing you can do is unload into Tether as your safety net. If there is one thing that could actually cause a long term destruction of trust within the cryptocurrency investment ecosystem, its Tether having a run up on their liabilities and not having enough reserve to cover the leverage. It would not only bring down exchanges but lead to years of litigation and endless media headlines that will scare off everybody from putting fiat in. I don't know when the next Mt.Gox meltdown will occur but I can almost guarantee it will involve Tether. So stay away from it.

**What should long term investors do?**

For long term holders a good strategy to follow each year is to capture profit each December and swallow the capital gains taxation liability, park a reserve of fiat at Gemini (whose US dollar deposits are FDIC-insured) and simply wait till around late January to early February to re-enter the market at a discount and hold all year until next December. You can keep a small amount in core coins in order to trade around various Q1 opportunities you anticipate. Others may choose to simply do nothing and just keep holding throughout January which is also a perfectly fine strategy. The cyclical correction usually stabilizes toward late January and early February, then we see a rise in March and generally are recovered by end of April. Obviously this decision whether to sell in December to profit on the dip and pay tax liability or to just hold will depend on your individual tax situation. Do your own math sometime in November and follow suit. 

Essentially revaluate your positions and trim your position sizes if you don't feel comfortable with the losses.

#How to construct your portfolio going forward
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rather than seeing the correction as a disaster see it as a time to start fresh. If you have been FOMO-ing into bad cryptos and losing money now is a time to start a systematic long term approach to investing rather than gambling.
 

**Follow a methodology for evaluating each cryptocurrency**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Memes and lambo dreams are fun and all, but I know many of you are investing thousands of dollars into crypto, so its worth it to put some organized thought into it as well. I can't stress enough how important it is to try and logically contruct your investment decisions. If you follow a set methodology, a checklist and template you will be able to do relative comparisons between cryptocurrencies, to force yourself to consider the negatives and alternative scenarios and also sleep comfortably knowing you have a sound basis for your investment decisions (even if they turn out to be wrong). 

There is no ideal or ""correct"" methodology but I can outline mine:

**1) Initial information gathering and filtering**

Once I identify something that looks like a good potential investment, I first go to the CoinMarketCap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer. 

* Critically evaluate the website. This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like ""Web 4.0"" or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. 

* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc

* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account? 

* Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?


**2) Fill out an Investment Checklist**

I have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:

* What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?

* What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?

* Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?

* What current product exists?

* How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?

* What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?



**3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple** 

I have a background in finance so I like to do Excel modeling. For those who are interested in that, this [article is a great start](https://hackernoon.com/the-7-things-you-need-to-know-from-the-valuing-cryptocurrency-conference-call-c238095a03b9) and also Chris Burniske has a great blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto.

[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done using his model](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit).  You can download this and play around with it yourself, see how the formulas link and understand the logic.

Once you have a model set up the way you like in Excel you can simply alter it to account for various float oustanding schedule and market items that are unique to your crypto, and then just start plugging in different assumptions. Think about what is the true derivation of value for the coin, is it a ""dividend"" coin that you stake within a digital economy and collect fees or is it a currency? Use a realistic monetary velocity (around 5-10 for currency and around 1-2 for staking) and for the discount rate use at least 3x the long term return of a diversified equity fund.

The benefit is that this forces you to think about what actually makes this coin valuable to an actual user within the digital economy its participating in and force you to think about the assumptions you are making about the future.  Do your assumptions make sense? What would the assumptions have to be to justify its current price? You can create different scenarios in a matrix (optimistic vs. pessimistic) based on different assumptions for risk (discount rate) and implementation (adoption rates).

If you don't understand the above thats perfectly fine, you don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do

* [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. 

* Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. 

* If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price. 

Once you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead  you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.

Once you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how ""smart money"" does it.

**Think about your portfolio allocation**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

You should think first in broad terms how you allocate between ""safe"" and ""speculative"" cryptos. 

For new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC, ETH, LTC. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.

You should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:

* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc

* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc

* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc

* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc

* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain, Walton, WABI...etc

* Promising/Innovative Tech segment - Raiblocks, IOTA, Cardano...etc

You should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a technie who loves the technology behind Cardano or IOTA, invest in that segment.

**Think of your ""circle of competence""**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? 

This where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. 


**Continually educate yourself about the technology and markets**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.


#Summing it up

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I predicted a few days ago that we would have a major correction in 2018 specifically in the altcoins that saw massive gains in Decemeber/early January, and it seems we've already had a pretty big one. I don't think we'll have a complete meltdown like some are predicting, but some more pain may be incoming.

Basically take this time to think about how you can improve your investment style and strategy. Make a commitment to value things rather than chasing FOMO, and take your time to make a decision. Long term investment will grant you much more returns as will a systematic approach.

Take care and have fun investing :)

We just made history that after all the FUD these months, we still climbed our way back. Crypto is here to stay and step by step the adoption is getting real! El Salvador is already profiting by adopting BTC and buying the dips.

The upcoming months will be legendary and with altcoin season around the corner we have some good times to come.

99,Selling all my crypto because of an authoritarian government,14295,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ldh53f/selling_all_my_crypto_because_of_an_authoritarian/,1902,"Hi guys,

I'm from a third world country called India. The right-wing fascist government here is planning to ban all cryptocurrencies. (They are so tone-deaf they called Bitcoin a [""private cryptocurrency""](https://www.newsweek.com/india-drafts-bill-create-government-cryptocurrency-ban-private-cryptocurrencies-exceptions-1566558)). 

Of course, you can never ban Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature and you might be thinking why I am selling my crypto when I could just as easily use a VPN. Well, the answer is that you don't live under this government. In 2019, the country was undergoing civil unrest with riots in the capital in the [CAA protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests) against a bill that discriminated based on religion. They silence journalists, kill protestors, and control not only just the media but also the judiciary. It's. fucked. up.

Currently, many [farmers of the country are protesting against the new farm laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Indian_farmers) which have been deemed anti-farmers and pro-corporate. The government was apathetic to the protest initially and then they were cruel, and brutal. 

[When Greta Thunberg and Rihana tweeted about the issue](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rihanna-farmers-protest-mea-7173657/), the government lost its mind and used the Ministry of External Affairs to issue a statement... against a pop star and a teenager. The protestors are also dealt with harshly and Delhi has been turned into a fortress keeping them out; more than a hundred farmers have died but the government remains apathetic.

Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India prohibited all banks in India from accepting cryptocurrency transactions in 2018. However, the industry went to the Supreme Court and the order was deemed unconstitutional in March last year. The crypto industry rose in India again and just as more people were buying in, the government comes out with a bill that fines a person 3x to 10x their gains on crypto or a jail term up to 10 years, or both. 

The worst part is that the bill states that it's up to the government to decide how people should dispose of their crypto after its banned. And you know what, it's not beyond this government to take all the crypto for themselves and claim they ""destroyed it"". [All governments have a history with corruption in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scandals_in_India). My exchange is linked to my bank accounts and my central government tax ID, and they can easily track me. 

That's why I'm selling everything I have, for now, just to wait it out and see what happens with the bill here. I really don't want to sell but I think it's better if I cash out instead of letting the government decide what I should do with my coins or face jail time.

I know India is probably not in your circle of concern right now but Bitcoin was about decentralization, about resisting government censorship and it seems the fanatical government is hellbent on making sure nobody can hold crypto by threatening harsh punishments and penalties. However, this is also good for crypto because the government is scared of it due to its growing power, just like its scared of Rihana and Greta Thunberg. 

I hope the bill never passes but most likely it will and bring an end to the crypto industry here again.

I just don't want to see more people falling for trash projects like these so please beware. The fake bots will already downvote this thread but I am hoping it will at least reach some actual users in here.

Here are a few coins that I looked into that are completely scams but are widely being promoted.

Safemoon, safemars, safegalaxy, elongate, Zepplin dao, ravenX, fox finance, moon pirate, moonrate, hungry bear. Basically any coin which says ""they will give you coins for any transaction on the chain and then will burn x% more"".

The idea of naming it ""Safe"" ""moon"" should be a good enough of a red flag.  Safemoon and these other coins has 1 wallet with more than 50% of the coins. You will see a hoard of fake users/profiles just trying to promote it. These coins have no utility, it is just a ponzi scheme with the entire idea being that people who come in last are gonna be bag holders and everyone below will make a portion of the bagholders investment if you bail out early before the rug pull. These people are trying hard to get you into safemoon etc. because they wanna hoard more money and they don't give a fuck about the people who are gonna be bag holders in the end.

Do not think that lot of people are buying the coins and you are gonna be missing out on 100x gains, majority of the people posting screen shots or talking about their experience are fake profiles.

How they try to entice you?

1. They are going to show their profits
2. They are going to promise exchange listing (Binance, Kucoin, their own exchange) which will never come I promise you.
3. They say they are transparent because they put couple of stooges for some dogshit AMA
4. They come up with some charity cause to make you feel not guilty about being part of a ponzi scheme or play on your good nature in general.
5. They make the coin value be well below 1 dollar like ($0.0000001) so its more enticing to you to get in on, giving you hope that its going to reach 1 dollar someday LOL.

It's mind blowing how some people play these mental gymnastics with themselves  to justify their ponzi scheme. ""I made 100x gains"", ""is it wrong for the little guy to make money"", ""i will put 50% of  profits into legit coins"".

I don't want these shit coins to be the face of crypto for all the new comers. Stop promoting/getting into these scam coins for a quick buck, it is just gonna give crypto space a bad name.

But don't let that detract from the fact that it elevates you to the status of someone who wired $1,000 to an anonymous person on the internet in exchange for some magical beans.

You'd be stupid not to have money invested in cryptocurrency these days, but keep in mind that it's almost entirely based on speculation, and a lot of your success is based on pure luck. In a bull market, everyone is a brilliant investor. People who post here pretending to be seasoned investing gurus are more often than not people who got lucky a few times. Have fun with your Baron Rothschild memes, pretending that everyone who invests in cryptocurrency will become a millionaire.

This is not the first time in history that a generation of young people has gotten rich by jumping on a wild speculation train. People had the same attitudes at the height of the dotcom bubble. ""Twenty-five percent returns in a year?"" Those are scrub figures. Anything less than 100% is not acceptable!"" We all know how that ride ended, and this one will as well. This ride will come to an end, whether it ends in a major bust or becomes a mainstream financial tool dominated by Wall Street. Take advantage of the high returns while you can.

Lastly, If you have the money to do so you can manage your risk by diversifying. Yes, the goal of diversification is to have a completely uncorrelated asset. Because all cryptocurrencies are highly correlated with one another, diversifying requires diversifying in a completely different asset class. Investing in another coin is not considered diversification; it is equivalent to investing in McDonald's and KFC and calling it diversification.

I learned a lot. I watched him tell our friends to buy doge coin, saw him put lump sums into BTC and BITCOIN CASH, and heard him tell me about lots of coins that seemed like they wouldn't pan out long term and I tried to hold my breath. 

At this point (around April) I thought, hey, I know a little bit now, time to start my portfolio. I did something different than him, and put 25 dollars in each week. He kind of made a little fun of me, said it was ""cute"" that I was investing and trying, and also said it was kinda pointless to put that little amount of money in. 

Then came the ""crash"" that I was completely prepared for and mentally ready to see, and I just ... continued to put in my money weekly. He ""no longer wanted to talk crypto as much"" and stopped putting in money because all of his was already invested.

Deposit made on Christmas day 2021.

I got the usual CB email saying they'd received my deposit, and the tx is confirmed on etherscan.

The coins were never put into my portfolio.

I opened a support ticket, and got a vague non-answer by reply (we're looking into it). It was promptly closed without explanation. I have since opened another 3 tickets which have all been met with similar vague responses, and then the tickets are closed without explanation. My requests to make a complaint have been ignored. I posted on their subreddit 2 weeks ago and got another vague response, no DMs etc.

I've posted there again today but don't expect much.

My account is not suspended etc., I am still able to transact with existing funds and deposit fiat. I tested this yesterday.

The funny thing is I trade high volume and had I continued using CBP, I would have paid them multiples of the value of this deposit in fees over the next 12 months. Congrats, you played yourselves.

I was able to live with CBP constantly going down during periods of volatility (sus AF!) but this is crossing the line.

**I am purely posting to encourage others to stay away from coinbase and CBP.** I am not the first person this has happened to. There are literally hundreds of posts like mine on their support sub where people have had funds vanish and the support team just ignores them.

Aside from this their fee structure sucks anyway. People seem think CBP is the cheapest for fees but they're only the cheapest if you trade over $100k per month. I only used them because it was a quick cash onramp from my Revolut account. I'll be sticking with Binance and Kraken from here on out. I will also be looking at the LRC DEX because they pay you to trade.

Be careful where you leave your funds.

EDIT: Lots of people doubting the legitimacy of my post which I guess is healthy skepticism. When I get home from work I will redact my personal details and edit in links to my (very one sided) correspondence with Coinbase.

Edit 2: I've done the above with mods.

**Edit 3: RESOLUTION!** Thank you all so much for your support. I'm happy to report that Coinbase were **magically** able to resolve my issue straight away after I tagged their reddit support account on this post. I received the mail in this image:

https://ibb.co/b61rYK8

I went straight to filing a complaint and within about 10 minutes my account was credited with the missing funds. They have devalued by about 30% ish since I sent them, and I sent them to be sold immediately at the time, but I seriously doubt I'll get anything else out of CB. I'm just glad to get my coins back at last.

Thank you all again. Naming and shaming most definitely works.

Also, a final word, a lot of people are looking for alternative exchange recommendations. I am in the EU and use binance a lot, also have a Kraken account and they have been recommended by a lot of people. But I know these aren't great options for some people in the USA.

I'm also going to look at using the LRC DEX for trading as they pay you to trade via negative fees! Amazing. I don't believe there's any geo blocks on this either. The issue I experienced makes me think DEXs are the way forward.

As per his bail release, he may not transact over $1000 without approval.  If he violates the terms, his bond may be forfeited - which means his parents home could be forfeited.

Lets look at what the scammer has been upto: 

In 2020, he tweeted his wallet addresses in an effort to seek ownership control over SushiSwap. 

[Sam casually tweets his address out. ok uh](https://preview.redd.it/8e7seijnwy8a1.jpg?width=1228&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ec2dfe64e1580cae19e4aa02795cce494d7651ff)

And just to confirm he completely controlled this address, the then head of SushiSwap - Nomichef tweets that he has transferred control of Sushi to Sam.

[Nomi: I'm transferring control to SBFAlameda now.](https://preview.redd.it/ix5d08pbxy8a1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=267452f0f24c8a801416da2965f0ed65b1b33b28)

And what do you know... this wallet was just emptied out, right after Sam got released on bail.

Here is the wallet: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xd57581d9e42e9032e6f60422fa619b4a4574ba79](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd57581d9e42e9032e6f60422fa619b4a4574ba79) (lets label this as ""**0xd575**"")

Around 0.66eth was sent out from here to another wallet, thus emptying this wallet. 

And if you follow the trail from here, the funds finally end up on a no-KYC exchange: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8f296def58797cc48c5e6bdc047535b2eecaeab](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8f296def58797cc48c5e6bdc047535b2eecaeab)

Over $50k were swapped in this manner. 

This is just in one wallet. One of the other intermediary wallet which received funds from ""**0xd575**"" is ""**0x7386**"". This wallet has recieved hundreds of thousand in the last couple of days, all of them eventually cashing out to no-KYC exchange. 

Here is that intermediary wallet: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x7386df2cf7e9776bce0708072c27d6a7135d51cb](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7386df2cf7e9776bce0708072c27d6a7135d51cb)

The pattern is similar - the wallet receives funds, and swaps them via no-KYC exchange to launder the funds.

This shows that the wallet that is directly linked to Sam has been cashing out. 

These are not transactions made by the Bankruptcy trustee, since any transaction they make has to be signed off by the bankruptcy court first and furthermore, they wouldnt use a no-kyc exchange to hide their trail.",2022-12-30 05:15:58

2. burning supply to artificially pump the price is a giga red flag and will make ETH lose market share to its competitors which will ultimately REDUCE its price (compared to what it could have been) instead of increasing it.
3. if a coin with the codebase of bitcoin would release today it would be labeled a shitcoin and forgotten faster than the average time it would take to make a block, which to be fair, takes a while.
4. crypto will not make everybody ""financially free"". if everybody is rich, nobody is. you just want to ride on the back of the people that missed the crypto train that then have to work for you if crypto really flips fiat at some point.
5. its not enough for crypto to be ""not as bad"" as the traditional banking system.    
want to be the future? behave like it. be efficient. don't waste a fuckton of energy. don't have fees that make it impossible to buy a fucking ice cream without paying double.

144,Don’t get burned with Dogecoin,12344,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mt1xzi/dont_get_burned_with_dogecoin/,3691,"Today on r/Dogecoin a user posted a video of himself: he sat in a chair, his head concealed by a pillow case, a black revolver pressed to his temple. He ranted about the lies surrounding Dogecoin and said he planned to kill himself. All I know is that he lived long enough to post the video. It was quickly removed by mods. 

So, before you buy Dogecoin, you should know what you are getting. Here’s a short summary:

Dogecoin has a huge supply. 129 billion coins. 10,000 coins are mined per minute. That’s 14 million new coins added to the supply every day, which adds up to about 1 billion coins added every eighty days. 

Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins. So, Dogecoin mints more coins every two days than Bitcoin will ever have in circulation. That’s why doge will never be priced like Bitcoin. And, in fact, at about $9 per Dogecoin, Dogecoin would equal Bitcoin in value. 

Dogecoin has no real ecosystem to make it valuable. It is not fast: 33 transactions per second. ETH 2.0 can handle 100,000 per second. So Dogecoin can’t serve as a currency. It seems to have minimum dev work. And it’s fueled by people who think they are getting into doge early. If you buy now, you are not. Dogecoin is not the future of anything. 

With Dogecoin, you are buying hype. 

And hype might push Dogecoin to 69 cents. Maybe to $1...but there is zero reason for doge to hold that value. In fact, at $1 per Dogecoin, with 1 billion coins added every 80 days, doge would need $1 billion in new investment every few months JUST TO MAINTAIN $1.00 

Also, be aware that $129 billion (doge at $1) is a huge market cap. That’s the same value as STARBUCKS. And doge has almost zero use-case scenarios. Sure you can buy some Mavs merch. Maybe find some occasional doge fans that accept it as payment. But doge can’t scale to be a currency. It’s too slow. 

Doge, frankly, is way overpriced right now. And Doge is going to have trouble maintaining it’s value due to its always-expanding supply. If the hype falls off just a bit—doge will fall, too. And twitter’s algorithm is heavily weighted against repeat trends. You might make money with doge, but it is far from guaranteed, and there is a fairly hard ceiling due to doge’s constant supply. 

If you buy doge, you are buying hype and Elon Musk tweet energy and nothing else. 

Be careful.",2021-04-17 23:49:54

Since when are the people teaming up with those that are the root cause of their problems?

Now I know that some names like Elon Musk can be pardoned for one reason or another but seeing Michael Saylor and Mark Cuban talk Bitcoin with the very embodiment of centralization - CZ Binance... I don't like where this is going.

Not to mention that we all expected BTC to become peer-to-peer cash, not a store of value for edgy hedge funds... It feels like we are going in the opposite direction when compared to the DeFi space and community-driven projects.


As far as I am concerned, the king is dead. The Billionaire Friends & Co are holding him hostage while telling us that everything is completely fine. This is not what I came here for and what I stand for.

If you, for some reason, experience this so called dip as an actual dip, or something negative at all..

162,Last night I was the victim of a SIM swap.,11598,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nmfws6/last_night_i_was_the_victim_of_a_sim_swap/,1647,"It all happened very quickly.

At about 11:58PM I received a text that a new phone service had been activated on my number with a carrier I don't use. It came with a link to a password protected (PIN setup when the service was purchased) PDF file that contained the contract for the start of service. I had a friend of mine crack the password to the PDF which ended up being 13371337 (lol). They filled out the form with bogus info for the name and address.

[Password protected start of service form.](https://preview.redd.it/geqpvl86wp171.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4ee7ddaa660dd2036d9708b55a20cee5e36eb5cd)

At this point my phone number had already been stolen and my phone lost service, being unable to text or make phone calls.

&#x200B;

I tried logging into my email account, and the password had been changed. Since my mobile number was linked to my email account, the attacker was able to now use my number to get the code to reset the password. I thought I had removed the phone number from this account but apparently I missed it. At some point last year I anticipated this happening and switched most of my 2FA to google authenticator instead of SMS, which ended up saving my ass last night.

&#x200B;

At around 1:44 AM I was thankfully able to regain access to my email account by using my backup email address on file which the attacker thankfully hadn't changed, and also provided some other info to my email provider to prove ownership.

At first nothing seemed out of place until I checked my deleted messages folder and saw password reset requests for three different cryptocurrency exchanges I have held accounts on. Two of these don't hold many funds but the third currently holds a fair amount of my coins. (This is another reason you should keep your coins off of the exchange).

Time frame was as follows:

**11:58 PM:** I get a text about service being activated for my phone number, I lose phone service.

**12:08 AM:** My email password is reset. I don't notice this for over an hour.

**12:09 AM:** Coinbase password reset request.

**12:13 AM:** Kucoin verification code sent to my email.

**12:14 AM:** Kraken username request sent to email.

**12:15 AM:** Kraken password reset request sent to email.

&#x200B;

As you can see ***the entire attack lasted less than 20 minutes***, which is terrifying.

&#x200B;

Thankfully I had Google Authenticator 2FA setup on all of these accounts so the hackers were not able to gain access and drain my funds. Anyone using SMS verification should switch to Google Authenticator because this is the one thing that kept my coins safe. I still need to recover my phone number and at this point I feel like I should change my number or carrier. My mobile carrier only requires a 4 digit pincode to login and make changes which is probably one of the weakpoints that allowed this attack to happen.

My information was leaked in the Ledger breach that happened last year and I am positive that this leak is what caused me to be attacked last night. I am sure I am on a list being passed around and some of you might be as well. Please exercise caution, secure your passwords and enable Google Authentication and 2FA on everything you can.

Edit: So I spent all day at the carrier stores to get this figured out. Since my number was ported over, then cancelled, I was unable to port it back to my original carrier to finish out my month of service. I went to Metro by T-Mobile and was able to get my number back but I had to buy a new phone since my current device is not unlocked. All in all I ended up having to spend about $200 to get my number back.",2021-05-27 19:49:52

I heard about this token a week ago and I went to do research. What I found? 1000x evidence that this was a scam, but I was intrigued.

I thought, let me put 10$ in this just for funnies. I got around 661 SQUID.

As the days went by, I started seeing it climb, 1$, 2$, 5$, 10$, 30$, and I was thinking... Imagine if I can take this money out. Of course I knew that I wouldn't ever take the money out, I was fully convinced of that, but it was fun to see it happen.

Couple of days later, I go to check the SQUID price and it's at 2000$. I was like wtf? 2000$ times 661 SQUID is 1.3 million dollars. I was a crypto millionaire.

5 minutes later it crashed down to nothing, but the 10$ wasn't for nothing.

I'm now able to say I was a crypto millionaire at some point of my life.

**REMINDER: Don't ever put money on scam coins, always do your research and be careful on what you invest. I was fully aware of this scam.**

EDIT: A lot of people been asking why didn't I sell at 1$ or 20$ or 100$. The reason I didn't sell it was because I couldn't sell. The liquidity pool was closed by the devs since the beginning, meaning that NO ONE could sell/swap their tokens for BNB or USDT or anything else. If I was able to sell I would have sold at 1$!

165,"Solend, the largest lending market on Solana is about to have a crippling liquidation of $170m SOL that could crash the network. To prevent this, the decentralized protocol is proposing to seize the user's funds via governance",11510,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vfszpt/solend_the_largest_lending_market_on_solana_is/,2281,"There is a large liquidation watch on Solana's Solend protocol, where a whale has  deposited 5.7M SOL  ($170M and borrowed 108M USDC and USDT borrowed. This alone accounts for a huge % of borrowing on Solana, and now this position is under a liquidation threat. 

The whale is not closing their position. In most protocols like Compound, or AAVE, Maker etc, this will result in an onchain liquidation. Infact we have seen many such large liquidations on AAVE And Maker recently, and everything has worked as expected. 

However such a large liquidation in an illiquid market and unstable network like Solana is likely to have vastly damaging consequences. Solana network has already gone down and halted half a dozen time. 

The Solend team explains what could happen to the network:

>This  could cause chaos, putting a strain on the Solana network. Liquidators  would be especially active and spamming the liquidate function, which  has been known to be a factor causing Solana to go down in the past.  
>  
>**Letting a liquidation of this size to happen on-chain is extremely risky.**  DEX liquidity isn’t deep enough to handle a sale of this size and could  cause cascading effects. Additionally, liquidators will be incentivized  to spam the network in an effort to win very lucrative liquidations.  This has been known to cause load issues for Solana in the past which  would exacerbate the problems at hand.

So to prevent this, they are proposing to literally steal the user's funds and execute OTC trades:

>Grant  emergency power to Solend Labs to temporarily take over the whale’s  account so the liquidation can be executed OTC and avoid pushing Solana  to its limits. This would be done via a smart contract upgrade.  Emergency powers will be revoked once the whale’s account reaches a safe  level.

When shit starts to implode, all the true colors of decentralization comes out. 

These shitty protocol are run by fly by night cowboys who learnt basics of economics during the bull run. They put their users are risk by running terrible protocols that do not think about all the edge cases...because who cares about risks right?!

The vast majority of people do not invest any kind of money into their future, all they think about is how to spend it on material stuff - as long as you're intrigued by the idea of holding a bunch of currencies that could potentially bring you financial freedom in the future - you're doing really great!

You really don't have to catch the next big thing or every single moonshot opportunity, as long as you're in crypto and chipping in funds every now and then, you're setting yourself up for great success in the future.

Once you've made substantial gains is also isn't a bad idea to diversify your investments, but that's on you. Getting out of debt is an investment too. Taking the time to understand projects and learn new things is an investment in yourself.

In 2014 I went back to school to study an engineering technology diploma and then last year went back again to take an advanced diploma in Ocean Technology. I got my dream job making better money.

I want to thank the cryptocurrency community for keeping me strong when I felt like I was about to lose it all and for also reminding me that taking profits is okay. I believe in Ethereum and cryptocurrency as a whole and I have no doubt I could make more money. But, I have met my goal and it is time for me to take profits.

Signed up on Binance, compeleted Basic verification.

Advanced Verifiation Successful

Fiat Account Verification Successful

&#x200B;

Sent the wire of 100k from the bank

Got an email saying they got the wire

Got an email saying they accepted the wire

**August 15th, 2020:**

Sent them an email asking why the account got disabled.

**August 19th, 2020:**

We made the video and sent it in. This is in hindsight, a mess up on our part, as he sent the wire from his closed bussiness account, which is now a personal account to him. The assets of the company were sold, but obvisouly the bank account is still his. You don't sell you bank account with a business, that would make no sense since a dollar == a dollar. But this is what we replied with.

>Attached is the video. I'm having trouble with attachment size, as it only allows up to 25mb, so I have to send the bank statement in another email. I had to make the video 720p. I'll also like to add that R\*\*\* Electric Construction Inc was my business but is no longer going since I've retired. Please see next email for the Bank Statement. 

&#x200B;

**August 21st, 2020:**

Didn't hear from them, so we sent another email

>Sorry to reply again. Just trying to think of what it means about the 7 DAYS REFUSED, and the only verification that took a long time was the Advanced Verification, because I only had it half done for a week, I have quite a few emails about it saying failed during that time it wasn’t complete. I eventually finished it and have the email saying it was successful. Then I completed the Fiat Verification as well. I need the reason why it failed and what verification it was, so I know what to do. Does it have anything to do with the wire itself? If I can’t get verified for what ever reason, how do I get my money back? I’d like to just get this done and use your exchange. I’m getting worried, as I have no clue why my account was locked in the first place.

>It has now been a whole month since I have sent you all my information proving that I own the R\*\*\* Electric bank account. It has been exactly 3 months now trying to get my money back. What is the problem here? I am losing my patience, how would you like it if a company locked your account and wouldn’t give you your $100,000 back? Why did you accept the wire transfer only to close my account a minute later and make me fight for my money? If within the minutes of you accepting the wire transfer and locking the account, that means you knew that you shouldn’t have accepted it. You guys are playing with me. It doesn’t take a month to review 5 pages of info and send a wire transfer. Do I need to buy a plane ticket and pay you a visit? Email doesn’t seem to be working too well. I have a cousin in California who is a judge as well and will take legal action. I didn’t want to play this card but I have no choice left, if this goes for another week. I want my money back. And where is the harm in sending back money exactly where it came from? I really don’t see why you have dragged this on for so long. Am I being targeted being over 80 years old? Are you waiting for me to die to keep the money?   
>  
>Don’t give me a one sentence response. I want full detail of the matter and an estimation of when that money will be back in the Ryan Electric bank account.

From here, we have nothing but problems trying to do a wire withdrawal. Sent him an email.

> When I go to the wire withdraw page, it has my name locked in and I can't change it to R\*\*\* Electric. Should I just wire it to my Greenwood Credit Union account instead, or do you think the wire will work with my name?

So we try it, and it's not working, we sent an email to him again.

> I started the wire, but I haven't received the confirmation email from Prime Trust. It's been around 20 minutes, checked my spam and everything. I added [info@primetrust.com](mailto:info@primetrust.com) to my contacts, not sure if that is the email to whitelist or not. Should I try to do another wire withdrawal?

**November 25th:**

Wire isn't working, tried a bunch of things but the confirmation email never gets sent to confirm and start the withdrawal. 

> Hey, I went to the account and under withdrawals it said failed, but like I mentioned I never got the email to confirm it. I tried again, and the same thing is happening. I attached some screenshots. 

&#x200B;

**November 27th:** 

>Hey Biggs, I’m not sure what to do about the wire transfer. I triple checked all the information and I know it’s correct. It knows the bank name automatically once I enter the information, which means to me the routing number is correct. It says failed under the status for each try I did. Even right after I put the info in, I never seen it say pending, or open, just failed. I’m not getting the email to confirm that I want to withdraw, so I don’t think your team will ever get it. I tried to use the checking account number instead of my savings and that didn’t work either. I can’t change the name of the wire to try to send it to the R\*\*\* Electric account, so I’m not sure what I should do. If you would let me buy DAI then get off your exchange, that would work, but don’t know the legality of that. Let me know, it’s been over that 72hr limit and I’m not sure what to do here.

Stuck in limbo, I tried to so a wire withdrawal 6 times, different banks, and even different account numbers for each bank. Never worked.

**December 6th:**

**THIS IS THE REAL KICKER OF THE WHOLE STORY, GET A LOAD OF THIS SCHEME.**

A little background here. I didn't try to do ACH originally because my grandparents are scared of online banking. I sent this email asking about doing ACH and if it is alright, and in the mean time, convicted my grandparents to sign up for online banking with Washington Trust, since that was the only bank that they have that was on Biances ACH list.

Mind you the account has been active now for a couple months, with withdrawals only enabled.

**December 6th:**

>Hey Biggs, my money is still on the exchange and wire withdrawals don't work it seems. Is there a way to maybe go straight to Prime Trust to withdraw it?

>That's the request ticket number that goes with the emails, incase I get someone other than Biggs. I need to get my money off the exchange, and I have been trying wire withdrawals at different times, and none of them worked. I never got the confirmation email, on 5 or more tries. I tried different banks, and accounts, nothing. I never heard back about it either. I never done online banking, but I saw ACH on the withdrawals page, and since wire isn't working, I decided to bite the bullet and enable my online banking with Washington Trust.

180,Coinbase has become the new Robinhood. They're artificially withholding Algorand withdrawals because of liquidity issues and do not want to lose out on their governance rewards. It has been over 24 hours now and they're pretending it's a technical issue.,11216,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ritaqq/coinbase_has_become_the_new_robinhood_theyre/,1997,"My guess is Coinbase is running on fractional reserves and doesn't wanna lose out on it's governance rewards so they are artificially delaying withdrawals of ALGO. I don't know about you guys but after I get my ALGO's withdrawn I'm finding an alternative to CoinBase. They have officially lost my business which is a shame because I've used them since getting into crypto.

They did this exact same thing before the 1st governance period in September and people lost out on signing up. This is no different than what Robinhood did with GME stock. It just shows that CEX's need regulation desperately and we're currently at the mercy of Coinbase assholes.

There have also been other strange things between Coinbase and Algorand. For the longest time they had Algorand listed as an ERC-20 token. Additionally they commonly do not post updated/correct news for Algorand. A few days ago they listed Securitizes Tokenization of Down Jones Index Funds as happening on Ethereum instead of Algorand, since then they've taken it down from Ethereum but haven't posted it to Algorand news.

This all smells a bit fishy.  I have been having this feeling for a while that coinbase is deliberately trying to undermine Algorand.

Does anyone know of a good alternative to Coinbase and Binance in the US?

&#x200B;

EDIT 1: They canceled my withdrawal after over 24 hours pending and said ""Blockchain transaction was compensated"". I'm wondering if I should try to withdraw again or convert to another coin and transfer off.

EDIT 2: Tried withdrawing again and it canceled almost immediately and said the same thing ""Blockchain transaction was compensated."" I'm pretty sure they still took my .002 ALGO transaction fee though. CB is fucking us over royally.

EDIT 3: Tried withdrawing once more, instant withdrawal cancel with same reason as before. I'm done trying to withdraw tonight. Will try again tomorrow in the AM and update the post.

EDIT 4: I was finally able to withdraw my ALGO's today. Look's like Coinbase most likely saw this post and bought more ALGO. The amount of ALGO in Coinbase 2 doubled and magically withdrawals were reenabled. Which means this was 100% a liquidity issue, and not a technical issue. Thank you everyone for contributing, I'm proud to be a part of this community. The elites get scared when all us little guys work together, never forget how powerful we are when we work collectively. This is the exact reason why we are all here, so huge monolithic entities can't dictate and control our lives without any recourse.

EDIT 5: MAKE COINBASE SQUIRM. Withdraw everything. Coinbase 1 is down to 351 ALGO and Coinbase 2 is down to <1 Million ALGO. Let's clean them out. Hopefully they will learn not to do this again.

EDIT 6: I've been reading some people are still having problems withdrawing. ",2021-12-17 23:06:05

The top rated post now is a post saying that banks consumed 520% more energy than bitcoin, even though the top comments are saying it's a bad argument, there still a lot of people who think the article is right, if you go on Twitter bitcoin maxis are always saying people are dumb because they don't get it how bitcoin is more efficient. Banks processed 200 billions of transactions last year against what, 200 million bitcoin transactions? You don't have to be a genius at math to see that there's no way bitcoin would win if it had the same amount of users and transactions. 

I'm not even getting into the argument that there are millions of people working for banks who likely would be working elsewhere and generating co2 emissions nevertheless. Those people work on different areas that you like it or not, are ""features"" bitcoin doesn't have, banks transaction output is not necessary related with their co2 emission because they do a lot more than sending money from A to B, you can't say the same about bitcoin, transactions = big energy output.  

""but defi is the future, we don't need banks"". You may be right, but if you look at sites like nexo/celsius, they are still companies with employees, they are competing with banks providing lendings, customer supoort, cards and insurance, not bitcoin. And they are doing fine.

""the media attacks crypto even though most a lot of coins aren't using PoW or will move to something else in the near future"". Hmmm, so you are saying there are better solutions out there and still its better to not talk about bitcoin's energy waste? Sorry, but this is just delusional. 

Crypto is at its core pushing technology forward and breaking paradigms, and with more adoption it also comes spotlight. If you look into the crypto space in 5 years and see that most coins and decentralized platforms are using something different than pure PoW, and bitcoin is still using PoW and consuming 10x energy from what it does now, you should think that's there's the possibility governments could act against mining, this year you saw hash rate drop with government-instituted blackouts in China, it wouldn't take much for countries to criminalize PoW mining if bitcoin is the only coin doing that and pretending nothing is happening while shouting ""I'm the king"".

https://imgur.com/gallery/SmC1o9c (banana and mango for scale)

So, what's going on right now in El Salvador? How did we get here?

Since Nayib Bukele announced that Bitcoin will become legal tender in El Salvador, you guys preferred profits over people. Why? Well, Nayib Bukele used his popularity to trick everyone he is a ""cool guy"", willing to sacrify himself in the name of the people. But, yeah he is just a Trump-wannabe that uses people's ignorance to stay popular. For example, he is blaming George Soros for pretty much eveything:

https://imgur.com/gallery/XGD0o9P

Yeah, everything: https://imgur.com/gallery/yRqyZV1

From accusing Human Rights Watch director ob being financed by George Soros: https://imgur.com/gallery/IyXFeBh

To accuse journalists of being paid by Soros:

https://imgur.com/gallery/JXUDigc


And even accusing congressmen/congresswomen of being financed by Soros because they supported the Engel List (A list of corrupt politicians in Central America)

https://imgur.com/gallery/XGD0o9P

Bonus track: Nayib Bukele even tried to interfere in a local US election, by asking people not to vote for a Congresswoman:

https://imgur.com/gallery/A9ytFTB

You did it reddit, you are supporting a President who is using the same ultra right-wing tactics that Trump used. 

Now, what's going on right now in El Salvador? 

Darkness. No really, we are being left on the dark. The Parliament approved the Bitcoin Law in LESS than six hours, and it was done very late at night:

https://diarioelsalvador.com/asamblea-cerca-de-aprobar-el-bitcoin-como-moneda-de-curso-legal/90324/

Some of our congressmen didn't even know what they were voting for, for real:

https://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/nacional/diputado-reynaldo-cardoza-no-entiende-bitcoin-apoyo-salvadorenos/871633/2021/

However, passing the law wasn't enough, since our country is still recovering from the effects of the pandemic. How is the government funding the Bitcoin Law? By reducing the education, and health budget and using that money to built the Bitcoin infraestructure: 

https://www.laprensagrafica.com/elsalvador/Restan-fondos-a-Salud-Educacion-y-asignan-a-Ley-Bitcoin-20210830-0081.html

(BTW I thought you guys were against reducing education budgets)

How is that money being used? We don't know. All of the information regarding the construction of Chivo ATMs, purchasing Chivo ATMs, purchasing Bitcoins, and the USD $30 bonus is NOW classified information. There you have it, we don't know who was awarded the lucrative contracts to build and equipt the Chivo ATMs. 

That hasn't stopped Nayib Bukele of proudly making Bitcoin related announcements:

https://imgur.com/gallery/ZtNqni5 (For real, no one knows about the costs of construction)

People are against using Bitcoin as legal tender. They don't care if someone trades Bitcoin/Ethereum/Ada/Shiba/Solana, the people living in El Salvador don't want is as a legal tender. We already went through this with the Dollar, it was utter chaos. Protests are starting to gather more and more attention:

Trust me, people here are not prepared to use Wallets or trade Bitcoins. You really don't know the situation in El Salvador, where people can take pictures with a smartphone or upload videos but don't know what an email is or how to reply to one. Even worst, old people cannot even understand what a password is. If you think that we ""need to educate people about Wallets and Cryptocurrencies because it is the future"", well come here and teach Salvadorans from rural areas about how to use a Wallet. Purchase a plane ticket and go to places like Cacaopera, Sesori, Chirilagua, San Alejo, Conchagua, and teach people about 2FA and Wallets. 

Don't get me wrong, I am not against Cryptocurrencies. I have in my portfolio BTC, SOL, DODGE, ADA, ETH, and even DOT. I tried teaching people about Wallets, its uses and how easy is to send money across the country or the world. It is not an easy task, and it requires at least two years of educating people. 

Finally, I was banned from /r/BTC for saying that people here in El Salvador will be forced to use BITCOIN. This morning, the government announced through a its legal advisor that we are obligated to accept payments in Bitcoins:

https://imgur.com/gallery/84TrO9p

Edit 1: I was banned from the /r/Bitcoin I apologize for the confusion

Update 1: Chivo Wallet is down. The Chivo Wallet app is not available in the App Store. It isnt in the Play Store either. Some people could download the app, but it crashed. President Bukele is asking patience. Also, the Chivo ATMs cannot be used. I drove to La Gran Via and currently is unavailable. By the way if you were planning a trip to El Salvador and withdraw some cash, you must transfer your Bitcoins to the Chivo Wallet first.",2021-09-07 01:06:18

Here’s a solution. Say you wanna hold for at least 5 years, but you’re afraid your paper hands mentality will take over and you’ll sell early, here’s what you do. 

1) invest as much as you can into BTC (or whatever coin you have faith in)

2) You commit a crime that gets you that many years, maybe armed robbery? GTA? I dunno, DYOR with the crimes in your local area.

Looking down the top 100, it may seem like you can just buy anything to 10x your investment, but this is a bull year, and that's survivorship bias in the coin rankings. (You're not seeing the 50 that fell out of the top 100.) 

Usually when you're feeling fomo around a growing project, you're already too late for x10 gains. If you're following hype pumps, you need to recognize when you're early and when you're late. That's not easy.

The better strategy is to dollar-cost-average into sturdy, longterm projects. Even a coin that ""only"" does x2 every year or two can be one of the best investments of your entire life—if it lasts.

190,"The market is crashing, and so is Crypto.",10964,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s98fhs/the_market_is_crashing_and_so_is_crypto/,6374,"The harsh truth is, the Fed is tightening its monetary policies and they're going to be raising interest rates very soon. The inflation rate is now too much to ignore as the people realize that their buying power is deteriorating faster and faster with little being done about it. As money is harder to get with the Fed reducing its balance sheet, there will be less money to invest into Crypto and the market.

# The Crash Has Already Started

When the Fed announced it was going to be raising interest rates, I warned about a market crash in a post I made just 10 days ago. Unfortunately, the crash I was talking about has already started as the stock market has started going down very intensely.

[Nasdaq Index Falling](https://preview.redd.it/c1prsr60x0d81.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9b99de9c7484ff94fef5d094639a23642155ff7e)

The pace at which the stock market is going down can very likely cause a situation like we've seen in 2008. This is going to cause panic and sell offs among people. We can already see people cashing out their stock market gains due to recent price action.

# Surging Inflation and Market Crash

If we see the history, every time there was high inflation, the Fed artificially triggered a market crash by aggressively increasing interest rates.

[Inflation and Interest rate correlation](https://preview.redd.it/wd2srkb9x0d81.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7b5f1b85ca4a3d6391366e947ad817a6503b8a33)

This rise in interest rate and the planned decrease of the Fed's balance sheet is going to have a severe impact on the market as people start borrowing less, spending less and investments into all assets start to dwindle.

# Biden Approval Rating

[Approval Ratings Fall Sharply Due To Inflation Concerns](https://preview.redd.it/tbvvccadx0d81.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=92a7d823dc5f2d5fe5d8d5ff38f00312168470ea)

With more and more inflation, people are losing trust in the Government and the approval rating is going down. The main reason behind this huge fall in approval rating is inflation, and the government needs to tackle inflation if they want to keep their approval rating from falling even lower as the public takes notice of their bills. The approval rating is a sign that the government needs to tackle inflation if it wants to keep public support.

# The Sell-off and the Opportunity

With the market crash ahead being very likely, people are taking their money out faster and faster. The Fed is no longer giving them free money very soon. The amount of people that are buying assets very low considering the current situation, and it is likely going to start going down as the interest rates are yet to be increased, which is when we will see the peak effects of the upcoming crash.

However, when crashes are at their peak, they leave most assets EXTREMELY undervalued. These are the times when you want to dump money into things like Crypto, which can rise extremely fast during a bullish market.

# Crypto's Correspondence With the Stock Market

The Cryptocurrency market is strongly correlated with the stock market, especially after more and more institutions have started to invest in Crypto. The Crypto market WILL react if there is a downtrend in the general economy. That is basically the reason we saw another dip in Crypto's prices today.

**TLDR**: The Fed will be tightening its monetary policies due to inflation and the stock market has started to crash. With the stock market starting to go down, we're already seeing the Crypto market react today, and unfortunately if the general market continues to dip, so will Crypto.",2022-01-21 11:11:15

Some bustard who tricked me into clicking on a dodgy link (pretending to be tech support for SNX on discord) has taken half my wallet so far (about $130k). The rest is still there but disappearing slowly in front of my eyes.

You can see all the transactions from this morning how he/she is cleaning up.

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be anything I can do other than jumping on the occasional ETH transfer they are making in so I can sweep it out.

The only reason I haven't shared my secret phrase with the whole world is a quiet hope I might one day get it back. But if  that's never going to happen maybe I should share it with you all. After all it would amuse me if someone else steals it before @scofield#0471 takes it all.....

EDIT: 

I can see people asking why am I not moving the coins out. The answer is I really, really, really tried. 
However there seems to be script which instantly transfer the coins to a different wallet, no matter what I type in for gas fees or the address. So far I failed on ALCX, on YFI, on SLP, on AAVE - so I have given up as I don’t know what to do a setting up a script myself is beyond my abilities. Whenever I add in ETH, all it does is makes its easier to the bastard to take my coins. So all I can literally do is watch right now.

SECOND EDIT

I was sent a link to a site which was going to validate my MM extension. The site looked real enough that I clicked on it and entered my security phrase. That was where I suddenly blew up 6 years worth of HODLing in one go….

THIRD EDIT

Normally I am hyper sensitive to security and very very wary of online support from strangers. However, due to a rare combination of sleep deprivation from staying up late to watch the Euro 2020 final, and not paying attention when I should have I made the fatal error of falling for what is now obviously a elaborate con. I’m so used to clicking approve on Defi sites to connect to wallets that my guard has as down and this looked genuine enough.

By the time I realised what was happening it was too late. I logged into MM from a MacBook as my original wallet was on pc, but it made no difference. They initially took 8 ETH, some sushi and old GNT I forgot to convert. With no gas fees the raid stopped. So I thought I would be quick and add a little gas and try and take some out. That didn’t work - no matter what I big in gas fees it was either immediately outbid (lost my aave and STETH) or accepted and went to another wallet which I didn’t recognise (lost my ALCX there). Later the fucker started liquidating my assets and put gas in to do this. I managed - and this was through the most frantic clicking and accepting any fucking gas bid at the highest price  to transfer out the ETH to a separate wallet. I managed to get some out which slowed the attacks as there was no ETH to pay for the gas. This would happen every hour and I managed to get about 0.05 ETH LOL 

This was totally my mistake and not due to SNX, who to be fair, warn you not to do what I did. But I was tired, had sent a message to their tech support sub and instead of reading the warning, ignored it like a noob so yeah - I own this and it’s my fault.

To those of you who think this is fake, I hope it never happens to you. I had to take a day off work to watch this slow motion disaster - I am sitting with a sick feeling, with pounding chest and periodically start tearing up which I can only assume is a slow motion panic attack. I have told my wife who is understandably shocked. When it all goes, I get to tell the rest of family that I got fucked over through ONE SINGLE LAPSE OF JUDGEMENT.

I posted this as a warning to the bulk of the community who could just as easily have fallen for the same

I used to look down on exchanges but they all look safer as least they have 2FA which MM lacks.

I’m pretty much done now with believing crypto will only change the world for the better and for the first time have been thinking, bring on more fucking regulation and make every wallet linked to an ID  - that way one day I can find out the bastard who cleaned me out and will spend what I have left on justice.

FOURTH EDIT

Thank you so much to everyone for their sympathy and support. To those of you telling me I’m dumb /stupid / foolish for so much holding on MM, thank for the comments but after the first 100 I stopped reading them as they get dull quickly. It was a mistake to leave so much on MM and with hindsight, the fact that my ledger wasn’t letting me connect to some Defi sites was an obvious flag rather than an obstacle.

So since this afternoon, I was recommend the flashbots service on discord by some of you. With some (read massive) trepidation about using discord again, I posted my details and one of their whitehat guys Alex got in touch. 

I won’t give all the details for now as he’s still on the case but he already rescued just over 40 steth that was staked on curve as a ETH/STETH LP pool. I’m overjoyed as that’s $85k that I had written off now back (and in a ledger before any of you ask).

I’m hopeful as to what happens to the remaining $35k but it already feels like a fuck you to the thief.

Thanks to those of you who told me some of my stolen money may have gone to kraken, I’m messaging them so I hope they can freeze the money and if I’m lucky even help ID the counterpart (not holding my breath though as I don’t know ifs it’s real and whether they will help or not).

With respect to the site I clicked on, DM if you really want to know but I left it off here in case someone else clicks on it and makes the same mistake I did. I’ve got in touch with the domain hosts to ask for their help in identifying the thief.

Obviously it not the best day in the world but feels a hell of a lot better than it did a few hours ago.

FIFTH and hopefully final edit

Thank you to everyone who has sent positive messages of support, both below and in the chat. They have really helped, especially at the start when I was super stressed with indescribable feeling of watching my account get emptied in front of my eyes and being powerless to do anything about it. The (useful) advice from people was helpful and I am especially thankful that the flashbots teams was recommended.

Alex has been been awesome. After he verified that the account was actually mine he stepped to stop the bleed (and I appreciated the fact that both the groups on discord and even this sub want to fact-check this to make sure it’s not a scam or a lie to flame someone). He set up a burner to remove incoming ETH which meant the thief couldn’t take more as there was no gas on the account. He then started to work on moving out the remaining coins to a safe wallet. At the time of writing he’s retrieved 117k from the 120k that was left (using this mornings prices). There’s a bit left which will hopefully come over but given how much was taken this am, that’s a rounding error on what I lost. For those of you who need his details DM or wait as I’ll edit one last time and add his Twitter account when this is all over and I’m calm. He has been amazing and whilst they ask for a modest fee it’s well worth it.

Thanks to Kraken for reaching out and apologies to SNX if it looked like I was blaming them for my mistake. Hopefully Kraken can help but I’m also going to message a lot of the other exchanges too - anything I can do to make the money hard to get for the thief will make me happy and maybe it might even get him caught (but really not holding my breath on that).

For those of you who keep wondering (1) no, I am not doing this for moon farming as making a few dollars and getting karma in no way makes up for a hit, (2) this isn’t a new account. I’ve been on Reddit for years but am usually silent as the chats can get poisonous quickly, (3) even I knew it was risky leaving so much on a hot wallet but I have used MM for a long time and found Ledger to be challenging with some Defi. I really wish I had been more careful but that’s done. I don’t blame anyone other than myself and the bastard who stole my coins but wish MM had 2FA which would have killed this or a way to hard freeze your account instantly which again would stop the bleed and work out a recovery and (4) for all of you who are sitting on your high horse lecturing me on how dumb this is and why you should never use your private data online - I fully understand and agree with your point of view, as YESTERDAY I would have been like YOU safe in the knowledge that nothing like this would ever happen to ME…..

It’s been a hell of day but I’ll be fine with time.

SIXTH AND FINAL EDIT

Okay so it been a surreal 24 hours. For those of you who want the full sequence of events it’s basically this.

I have a few different accounts but started using MetaMask heavily in recent months. Basically because Argent was heavy in gas prices and my ledger didn’t always connect to some of the DEFI sites I stitched to MM. Thanks to a run up in crypto market valuations, and some small trades and staking, the $20k was playing with 6 months ago in the hot wallet had became around $250-260k yesterday.

My first mistake was leaving such a large amount on MM. In fact I had been actively considering moving some of it but with hindsight waited too too long. At times gas prices on ETH have been insane and was my pure bad luck that yesterday was one of the cheapest days around where tx were a few dollars rather than $20-70 which I’d seen in previous weeks. Trying to save a few hundred bucks turned out to be a very bad decision.

With hindsight, I wish I had got up and gone to work and the worst that would have happened would have been feeling deeply disappointed by the England performance the night before.  Instead I went on to make one of the most expensive mistake of my life. 

I decided that yesterday I would finally get around to messaging the help desk at the discord chat for SNX and ask if they could help me with some SNX I had deposited there on the L2 wallet. The problem was, that I was able to see the amount of SNX on their Optimism mainnet which showed SNX token only but not but not my ETH, whilst the Ethereum mainnet showed my ETH and other alts but not the SNX tokens.

I went to the sub and asked for help in the chat. Got no response and tried a bit later. That time I got 3 people replying in private chats each claiming to be from SNX. Whilst the SNX sub warns against this, I was tired and assumed that maybe it was like some of the other subs where people can advise you if the mods are busy.

To my misfortune I replied to the scammer explaining the problem. He basically told me my MM wallet wasn’t syncing back to the network and I should validate it. That sounded plausible given I couldn’t see my total balances and also in recent weeks I’ve faced a glitch as time where the wallet balance comes up a zero for up to a minute when I first open it so thought maybe he’s right.

To help, he sent a link to quite a detailed looking site which looked real enough and unfortunately, thanks to weeks of linking random DEFI sites to my MM wallet  I had become unfortunately desensitised to connecting to random pages and accepting connections to my wallet

When I tried the link on the fake site, it wasn’t working apparently so Scammer suggested I try again. This time, I figured maybe I should try the option to connect to my wallet by entering my private pass phrase. 

Yes I know it was dumb NOW

Yes I realise it’s my fault.

I’ll live with this expensive mistake for a long time.

A strange set of events in which I was super tired, not nearly alert enough and my warning radar was off meant I went for the most basic and simple phishing scam. To those of you on your high horses laughing about how this can never happen to you - good luck and I hope you carry on living perfect lives in which you never make a mistake.

A few mins pass as the scammer is still engaged on the discord chat explaining it will take some time. He then causally asks me if I have a ledger and want to sync that too….

At that instant, I suddenly realise what I’ve done and get a cold sweat. Why the fuck should he ask that unless….

I check my MM wallet on zapper.fi and see that the wallet balance has suddenly dropped. I’m now missing $20k and a quick check shows my 8 ETH, some sushi and some Golem which I had are gone. 
 
I start to get super angry that I’ve lost 8 coins. After a few mins I calm down and suddenly realise that the only reason I haven’t lost more is there is now zero ETH on my account so no way to do more transactions.

It’s likely that he must have set up a copy of my wallet on his pc and started emptying it out. At this stage I’m becoming less angry about what’s gone and becoming deeply worried about the rest.

I send frantic emails to MM which aren’t answered until late in the evening and the next morning (which basically tell me there is nothing that can be done in my case and be more careful next time - thanks guys, will never be using you again.)

At this point, the major weakness of MM finally hits me. Forget the convenience, if all goes wrong I have literally NO way to stop any transactions (hell they don’t even show in my wallet but I can see them on zapper) or freeze the account. Consensys may have built a nice chrome extension but it’s useless if there’s a problem. 

At some point I look up and see that more of my coins are disappearing. 20 odd STETH suddenly disappearing is especially painful. I check on zapper and can see he is putting in ETH to put up gas fees to move stuff off the Defi sites and liquidating my coins and moving them out. Now I’m actively watching the account on zapper. Whenever I saw ETH come in I tried to first move the coins to my ledger but every single time it just goes to another unknown wallet. WTF? I eventually understand that they have copied my account on a different pc and are probably running a script to automatically outbid me. I had watched my one YFI go - that hurt as I had spent a BTC on it lol. I watched my 104 ALCX go - another 15 ETH gone in smoke. 

My whole accounts looks fucked and all I can literally do is watch….

Around this point I send my first panicked message to Reddit that I was down 130k and likely to lose the whole lot. I figure maybe between the likely ridicule and crap I will get, maybe I will get lucky with some help. 

In the meantime all I can do is try to run slight interference by trying to move some of the ETH that the thief was adding to another account. Strangely moving ETH to another wallet appears to be the only coin I could impact. When I can moved it I try and run a tx and cancel it with a high gas fee to disrupt the ETH balance and screw up his transfers. This slows the bleeding but it’s not over and I don’t know what I can do. I read messaged here about trying other pcs, logging out of MM, I try it all and it does no good and makes me more stressed that the scammer might be stealing more when I’m not watching.

When I first posted on Reddit I was down about half with the remaining amount staked on curve (alcx/ETH LP, zrx/ETH LP, ETH/stETH LPs) which was around 120k. Don’t know why they were last to go but thank god they were there.

In between the usual trolls and assholes calling me a liar, there were messages of support and some very helpful suggestions on then flashbots discord sub (initially sent to me by the SNX subs).

I messaged flashbots and Alex from there got in touch. I gave him full info and access to my ex to verify it was mine). Even he commented that I shouldn’t do this (lost track of how many times I heard that yesterday) but as my account was already compromised I had to trust it would be okay as without it he couldn’t do anything.

He explained that he would first set up a burner so any ETH coming in would be immediately burned leaving no gas for transfers. This was quickly set up which closed the gate on the thief for the short term. 

For those of you checking the wallet history you can see some incoming ETH which then immediately is removed - that scammer’s ETH he’s wasting now. I didn’t want to alert him as to what was happening, so there was minimal mentions of this on my posts to Reddit, which I was still checking as this forum sometimes has some very useful feedback and suggestions.

Over the next 8 hours Alex managed to move the remaining balance to a hard wallet and basically recovered all of my remaining balance minus some dust and dai staked on alchemix which I can’t get back so it’s all there which was around 117k out of 120k. I don’t know how he did it - if you really want to know go to discord and ask him - but I am overjoyed that he did what he did. It’s amazing for both his stepping in and spending hours to save this and no less for his 100% total honesty and integrity. If he had moved the coins elsewhere and told me it was the original thief I would never have known.

In the end I’ve lost about 55 ETH and saved about the same (values were all over the place as the market tanked in the evening).

I didn’t post for moons or karma. I posted as a warning and for help and I’m glad I did. I would never have found the courage to trust flashbots without it. I would not have been alerted to the scammer using Kraken to deposit the stolen coins.

To those of you who offered financial support/crypto/gofundme, thank you so much but there is really no need. Alex has saved a big chunk and I will be alright. Losing this amount of coins thanks to a scam is painful but if I couldn’t stomach large swings I wouldn’t have held on for years - if I can live through a few 80% drawdowns in BTC and ETH and recover, then I’ll come back from this okay (however for a while I will stop measuring my crypto value in $ rather than #coins lol).

Thank you very much to everyone who offered emotional support and well wishes. They are very much appreciated and more than make up for the large number of trolls and morons who like to throw around shit. Please don’t worry about me. My wife, whilst initially shocked and upset, is fully supportive and I have every confidence I will do really well (especially after EIP 1559 and later ETH 2.0)

To the libertarians, outraged that I’ve swung to side of more regulation, I want to say that I still believe that you should do what you want - legally. It doesn’t have to be totally anonymous - hell half the problem with the current version of the internet is anonymous trolls venting lies and crap everywhere. 

For crypto to go truly mainstream you need some degree of safety and the ability to follow up and prosecute crimes. Watching some c*** screw me over in real time was an infuriating and humbling experience and definitely made me resent the anonymity of the scammer…..

BTW for those of you who go on about being your own bank good luck and come back to the real world where actual banks are regulated and safe (unlike the current Wild West of crypto Defi) and remember many of us don’t want to be our own bank. I never thought about being my own bank and bought coins like ETH for other reasons. I like the blockchain and the crypto space as they are exciting and disruptive ideas that will hopefully make a new version of the internet in due course and change the world. However like the internet 2.0, no matter how it starts, eventually governments will step in and more regulation is coming. 

Mr scammer, I’ve already reported you to a bunch of exchanges where you seem to be staking your stolen coins and even if I can’t get you immediately, your records are permanently there on the blockchain and one day you will be fucking found….

Finally thanks again to Alex!

Don't delete that thing - mint it as an NFT and credit the sender as the original artist. 

Then, send them an invite to buy their art and remove it from the blockchain. If they don't, their name and nads will exist forever more in the very public blockchain, for all to see.

A coin price of 1 cent would mean a market cap of 344 billion, putting it on the #2 spot, higher than ETH. At 2 cents it would get close to BTC, at 5 cents its market cap would be higher than all other crypto combined.

Jay Clayton, the former SEC chairman, was a partner at Sullivan and Cromwell.    
Joe Lubin, co-founder of ETH, also founded ConsenSys. He also bought 9.5% of ETH supply.   
ConsenSys is a client of Sullivan and Cromwell.  
That was the back door ETH used to get the free pass on regulations.  
There are court papers about the meetings between ConsenSys and the SEC.  
At the same time, the SEC was prosecuting DOZENS of ICOs that were using the exact same approach ETH was.  
Hinman’s, Clayton’s Director of Corporate Finance, speech where he says ETH is not a security was partly WRITTEN by some of ETH top investors.  
The plan by ConsenSys with the help of the SEC was clearly to make ETH the only crossborders payment platform by giving it a free pass, while at the same time preventing any incursion into that space with SEC lawsuits.   
At the same time this was happening, Gary Gensler told an MIT audience that “XRP deserved regulatory clarity”.  (I won’t go in depth with the Ripple lawsuit here).  
Not only is Chairman Gensler trying to pretend he never said that, and the entire SEC trying to hide the fact they gave ETH a free pass, to date ETH is the only altcoin to have had the privilege of being formally consider a commodity/currency and not a security.   
Other funny “coincidences” include: Claydon being hired by a crypto hedge fund 100% invested in BTC and ETH. SEC Enforcement Director Marc Berger being hired by Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett, part of the ETH Alliance and Hinman’s prior employer, less than a month after the Ripple lawsuit was filled. Hinman receiving $15 Million, during his service on the SEC, from  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett. AND after leaving the SEC, Hinman returned to  Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett as a senior crypto adviser.  

**ETH is centralized:**  
Users and nodes have no real power to shape the protocol. This is virtually true of all protocols with a Foundation at it’s head, but we can’t forget ETH falls under this group.  
The first piece of evidence here is the ETC hard fork. This fork happened because the wrong people lost money. The changed the code and the protocol for the first time to suit the wealthy whales and not the users or miners. They changed the rules to fit their goals.    
The second piece comes in the form of changes to mining rewards. This was a blatant attempt to decrease supply by not paying the miners. More important than the way it impacts the economics of ETH, it points towards a centralisation of power. Rules can be changed on the fly with no consideration from the community but based on profits alone for the higher ups.  
This leads us to the PoS change. This has nothing to do with energy concerns or with price of fees. This is meant to skip all the intermediate problems by getting rid of miners and let the token holders leverage their will directly. Don’t forget the LUDICROUS amount of ETH that was pre-mined.  
Every hard fork the Ethereum blockchain has enacted has always been for the benefit of the few, never for the benefits of the community. You know what that looks like? Our current banking system. Where the citizens and the working class pay the price for mistakes and reap none of the rewards for profit.  
People in this sub hate central bank digital currencies, failing to see that every abuse these could enact on the public, so can Ethereum upon it’s users.    
To quote one of my sources “Etherium is not a decentralized peer-to-peer system. It is a system with an unaccountable ruling class exploiting the working class, making promises they can’t keep, while spinning a wonderful narrative.”  
  
**ETH recent and future design is bad:**  
Everyone was fooled into thinking EIP 1559 was going to be a good thing. How the Foundation pulled that off is honestly mind boggling.  
This change made it so fees were more uniform. Uniformly high. And making sure that miners saw none of that profit by burning it.   
Burning the fees essentially made sure that the biggest holders get they profits increased because every ETH is worth more, while miners that actually keep the network safe get a pay cut because there are less fees per block for them.  
But the biggest problem is that you are getting a landlorded network to users. If you want ETH to be useful, you need to, well, use it. But this model makes it so the interests of holders are opposite to the interests of users. Users want lower fees so they can use the network to transact, but holders want higher fees, for more burn and more profit.  
Taking money out of the pockets of miners decreases security. If you are paid less you have a higher incentive to get your money some other ways.   
And since users and holders have different agendas, future goals benefit different people. An interesting question would be for instance what happens in the case of a block size adjustment? Bigger or smaller block sized benefit users and holders differently.
Well, given ETH’s history, you know how those chips would fall. Even this decision was reached by a small amount of key players.  
And PoS will only make this whole process more straight forward. The fact that the token holding are already so centralized will make changes easier for the ruling class and be baked into the system.    

**In conclusion:**    
ETH’s had a shady start, has been controlled by a group of shadow players on the background, is becoming less and less secure and has no intention of not being.    
At any point, any decision can be hard forked in. The miners don’t matter. Your nodes don’t matter.  
ETH is INTENDED to shackle you the exact same way the current banking system does.    
Don’t be fooled.

199,On may 24th CEO of one of the largest bank in the world - HSBC publicly said that crypto lacks transparency and later it's UK branch started to block payments to Binance. Yesterday same British HSBC branch has been fined £63.9m by the UK's financial regulator for money laundering!,10689,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rj532p/on_may_24th_ceo_of_one_of_the_largest_bank_in_the/,2562,"This is the clear example of hypocrisy at its finest! Seven month before their CEO Noel Quinn publicly announced that HSBC will not be offering any services related to Bitcoin and crypto entirely to its users and linked his decision to the ""lack of transparency"" and high volatility in the cryptocurrency industry. As per Quinn, it is impossible for an agency to tell who owns the crypto, and hence everything depends on whether the holders can be ""trusted in regard to market integrity.""  

And yesterday karma hit them back, the same fucking swindlers are fined £64m for anti-money laundering failings. Actually, initially they were fined for  £91m  though since HSBC not disputed the findings and agreed to settle it was cut down to £63.9m. HSBC's failings cover a period of eight years, from 2010 to 2018, the FCA said.

[**The FCA's report into HSBC**](https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/decision-notices/hsbc-bank-plc.pdf) cites examples of poor controls, including failing to spot suspicious activity on the account of a construction director who also played a leading role in a criminal gang trying to steal millions of pounds by setting up fake companies. The person pleaded guilty to VAT fraud and went to prison. HSBC also failed to detect a customer imprisoned for smuggling cigarettes into the UK and ordered to pay £1.2m by the HMRC tax office, where the bank missed ""a sustained period of unusual activity,"" the FCA said.  


For those who did not know, in 2012 after an investigation by the US Department of Justice the same bank paid $1.9bn fine (£1.4bn) for laundering money of Mexican drug cartels, circumventing the rules designed to prevent dealings with Iran, Burma, North Korea and being financed by terrorists from Middle East.

209,I'm been in crypto since 2013. Maybe 700+ alt coins and many trades. Now a Defi-Crypto Farmer. Here are some of my tips and advice for new-comers.,10421,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/moilxv/im_been_in_crypto_since_2013_maybe_700_alt_coins/,1318,"As the title says I'm into crypto pretty deep.  I was in crypto briefly in 2013, but only really hit the ground running in 2017 and never looked back.  In 2017 I made all the usual mistakes, got into the wrong coins, entered some dodgy exchanges and sold the wrong coins (like selling Enjin on its first day after investing in the ICO).  In 2018 things got worse, with shitcoins driving the BTC value of my holdings down by half.

Now I'm sitting really pretty and feel like I have ""clicked"" to the point where I am generally making money in crypto and quite a few people ask me for advice on what to do, strategies etc.  Here are some of my tips, observations and ideas.

1. Don't trust anyone.  Assume everybody you are talking to is a friendly thief who wants your money.  That includes people shilling particular coins, or anyone asking for your crypto to invest, to random people that message you.  (And yes ironically this means don't trust me, but you'll see I didn't mention my altcoin holdings and I am deliberately staying quiet on what my 800% defi pool is  :) )
2. Every position you enter should be a fixed percentage of your portfolio.  I prefer 1% for a typical trade.  Risky uniswap gems might be 0.5%, very strong longer term positions say 2-5%.
3. Have your portfolio value in BTC (or ETH if you prefer that).  Your goal is to increase your BTC value.  Each trade should be from BTC, and then exit back out of BTC.  Log all transactions in blockfolio etc under the BTC pair, so you can see how much BTC value you are gaining.  Don't worry as much about USD gains, as in a bull market its easy to make USD value gains.  BTC is the end-game here so you want to accumulate BTC, especially if BTC dominance is falling.
4. Have a portion of your portfolio allocated to farming or staking.  If you have a coin sitting somewhere for ages, ask if there is some way for you to make money from it.  For example, I have a large stack of BTC and ETH, so rather than have it sitting doing nothing, I wrapped the BTC and entered a Sushi Farm.  Months later the rewards from that farm are worth something like 25% of the amount I initially invested.  Every so often, harvest the rewards and either re-farm (compounding) or shift to your long term hold.  Remember compound interest.  There are opportunities for very high returns (without ponzi aspects but be careful) - find those, constantly take and re-invest the income and the gains are quite extreme.
5. Have a dedicated stack of BTC or ETH that is your ""HODL"" portfolio that you never touch.  Preferably in seperate legal entity (like a trust) than what you trade with.  This will help for taxes.  Every so often, move some profits into that long term stack.   I don't do anything with that stack at all, it is just my safe holdings.
6. Spend as much time learning about tax as you do trading.  Tax is something you kind of need to understand upfront - you can get way more rekt from bad tax approaches than you make gains with good trading.  And keep your records safe - download all trade histories at the end of every quarter.
7. Use telegram (or discord).  Find really helpful smart and useful people and stick to them.  Find helpful trading groups.  Eventually they will be a vital source of information or just ways to bounce ideas off.  Check out my previous post for a full guide on ""must have"" telegram groups.
8. Read the crypto news as much as you can.  Its amazing how often something pops up (e.g. grayscale announcing new trusts with other coins) and there is still a decent amount of time to buy.  And always have some BTC on an exchange ready to buy on such an opportunity.  Again, telegram is great for this as you can quickly see tweets or news-links being shared.
9. Have a preset % of gain or losses whereby you will sell if it reaches that.  For example, for most coins, if a coin ever goes up more than 30% vs BTC in a day I always sell.  95% of the time that works out as better than holding.  In the rare event I double my position I always sell the principal immediately (I did this twice this year - with Ethernity and Blind Boxes).
10. Always have an idea as to what the current ""climate"" is in terms of what is moving and in favour.  Crypto markets often move with certain sectors at a time.  For example, if you look at the Coin Gecko categories list, you can immediately spot what is ""hot"" right now.  Last month it was NFTs, so I was heavy in that space, but now that sector is cooling.  The binance smart chain and exchange coins are doing very well right now - if that is the case what else might move?  Well other low gas blockchains could be an idea - especially if they have defi - so Avax, Raydium etc are all moving too.  Soon it might well be BTC's time to gain as the expense of alts.  You should be rotating in and out of positions to try and go with the ebb and flow of the market.
11. For newcomers, start with basic stuff like accumulating bitcoin, learning to use a wallet, security etc.  Don't just dive in and ape into defi coins, wsb style.  It may suck that it feels like you are missing all the gains from the ""hot"" new coins, but it will equally hurt if you are just burning through your capital.
12. Look out for free crypto opportunities.  They key here is sorting out the gems from the scams.  This isn't just staking etc but also things like reddit moons and airdrops.  A lot of people are even ""airdrop farming"" whereby you have wallets that carry out certain activities deliberately to try and qualify for future airdrops.  Coin market cap earn and coinbase earn are two more.  Even something like the binance ""dust"" feature to turn dust into bnb is a way of generating some more bnb (even if its tiny).  Check out my previous post on free crypto and ways to get passive income
13. For farming, make sure you are using the right apps like zapper or apy vision to track all your positions, your yield and any impermanent loss.  That will also help with tax records down the track, should you need it.  Watch out for farming on the ETH network as your gas fees will chew up any gains if you have small positions.  Check out my previous post of sushi farming for how the rewards and gains work
14. Track all your numbers, your gains, your investments and portfolio change religiously, preferably in an excel document.  That way you'll know how you are performing and if something is going wrong.  Again, I wish I had done this more in 2018.
15. Have an ""emergency reserve"".  For me, this is actually my stock positions, many which are crypto related, but you could have gold or cash (I especially like the idea of something like stable coins lent on FTX at a decent interest rate).  If we get some kind of crypto turbo dump which is 40%, you can then have that as money on the side-lines ready to buy.
16. Constantly educate yourself.  For me, I still need 3-4 hours a day to research and learn about crypto.  I find crypto podcasts and even youtube vital sources of information, provided you are listening to the right people.  Mix up your education with news, technical strategies, trading updates, altcoin news and even just the general philosophy behind sound money and financial sovereignty.
17. If you win or lose on a trade, delete that coin from blockfolio immediately.  Why?  Because you have exited that position, and seeing it jump up again in price is just going to torment you.  You've made the decision to sell, don't even up revenge trading where you come back and try and get your losses back on the same trade.
18. Never margin trade UNLESS it is only because you want to minimise your funds at risk on an exchange.  Even then I'd avoid it.  Unfortunately many exchanges make this very hard to use - and there are confusing terms and default options which can rekt you (for example, positions that will drain your other funds instead of liquidiating the trade if falls too much).  In fact, I avoid almost all USD pairings and only trade BTC pairing, unless very special circumstances are in play (such as ripple being delisted from coinbase).
19. Never hold more than around 10 coins.  I used to have up to 40 at a time, it became impossible tracking them in terms of activity, prices, and god the horrors of trying to maintain enough wallets for them.  10 is enough diversification.  I used to have a ""bag"" of around 15 moonshots - that strategy never worked as even if one ""Gem"" actually made it big, the losses from the other ones cancelled out.  Typically if I had a huge gain from one of my coins, I sell back to BTC and waits for other opportunities.  This isn't Pokemon - don't try and ""catch them all"".
20. Falling in love with alt-coins is like falling in love at a stripclub.  Yes trade them.  But just be conscious that their chances of beating BTC long term are very unlikely.  Just look at all my 2013 gems (peer coin, feather coin etc).  Heck I bought World-Coin because I read about a ""bitcoin genius teenager"" who made millions from crypto and said World-Coin was the next bitcoin.  And I've made my mistakes as well going forward, holding on for dear life for nano (yes I know its fast and instant!) and grin.  I think the tech for both coins is great, that doesn't mean its a great trade.  If you want to marry your alt-coins then you will be lucky if you only lose half your money like a real world divorce :)
21. EDIT. Bonus one.  Always learn from your losses (and I have MANY).  I like to think of crypto as like a computer game where you are gaining new skills.  Think of RPG games like Baldur's Gate or Warcraft.  You can earn money or experience, and use that to gain new items or skills that protect you against certain things.  So maybe you lost $500 to a ""rug-pull""?  Well do your research and figure out how to avoid that next time.  Maybe you'll spend the next 2 weeks mad about it, but next time a potential rug-pull project comes along you'll dodge it - congratulations you now have learned ""immunity to rug-pulls"".   Keep learning and gaining more experience and you'll start avoiding all the traps.
22. EDIT 2:  You are going to have MANY scenarios where you see a coin that has gone x1000 or to some ridiculous crescendo, where you feel utterly compelled to buy to avoid missing out.  This is the obvious trap (if you want an example of this look at Safemoon right now.  Bitconnect was the one in 2017 and there are others).  At some point bitcoin or ethereum will do a similar run up, and many people outside crypto will do the same thing.  Yes this can be irresistible but you must resist the temptation - think of the cryptos has being a bunch of boats on the wharf, and there are thousands of boats.  Every day another hundred turn up.  Why are you going to try and jump across the water to get to the boat that is already leaving, when if you wait a bit another few dozen will turn up in five minutes?  You'll just fall in the water and miss out on those new boats!
23. If you must trade as a new-comer, I highly suggest trading the smaller / middle cap BTC pairs.  Not the USD or margin pairs.  Certainly not something like futures contracts on FTX.  Why?  Because if you are on bitmex / bybit / ftx etc you are swimming with the whales and sharks, quant funds, robo-traders and the like.  If you entered the casino for the first time in your life, would you immediately go to the blackjack table with James Bond and Dr Evil?  The smaller BTC pairs are more likely to have less experienced traders - my trades actually went positive once I moved from USD pairs on margin exchanges to spot BTC trades with altcoins.
24. Last edit before bed (I promise).  The chances are, crypto is still cyclical.  That means we will have another bear market, or at least a very long boring period of no gains.  If you have just joined crypto, you probably won't ""make it"" this cycle, as we may only have 6 months to a year to go.  I actually lost money (a lot) in BOTH the 2013 and 2017 bull markets (-50% and -85%, respectively).   All of my gains were made in the bear market when I was buying BTC and alts when BTC was in the 3ks.  The ""will you make it?"" test isn't coming now when the market seems to be going infinitely up and everybody is winning.  That test comes when everybody is selling and it seems like you are the only buyer.  And yeah, thousands of alt coins will suffer or die at that point.   So be around to scoop up the ashes - don't be the ashes!  This is all a larger part of learning to move with the cycles.

Anyway these are the ones that come to mind, hopefully that is helpful!  No doubt I'll edit this post and add a few more.",2021-04-11 02:37:48
210,20% dip? 🤷‍♂️ Looks pretty normal to me.,10400,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lqqc1q/20_dip_looks_pretty_normal_to_me/,728,"It's April 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s making around 1.1 BTC each day. The price is crossing $2. 

It's May 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s, doubled. Mining difficulty is climbing quickly, and so is the price. We're almost at $10 by the end of the month and I'm still making around 1 BTC per day, somehow managing to stay on par with the difficulty as I buy more graphics cards.

It's early June, and as I am powering on even more GPUs, the price hits roughly $32 before halving over that weekend. 

November 2011, we reach $2 after several months of everyone declaring it dead. I am on something like 8 5850s now, probably still making around 1BTC, maybe a bit less, it's difficult to remember after 10 years. After the monstrous crash of about $30, things begin to pick up by the end of the year and we enter 2012 at about $5.

We crash from $7 to $4 between January and February, then from $13 to $8 over one weekend in August. It's dead, each time.

It's 2013 and things are batshit insane. We have some minor 10% drops through the year but everyone is buying. Everyone is mining. I heat my new rental property with Radeon 7990s and only heat the house with graphics cards during the entire winter from 2012-2013. About 11 steps up the stairs, you go from freezing cold to being blasted with heat, like when you exit the plane into Spain.

By April we all lose our shit and people are buying bitcoin for $100. By the 9th they are paying $200 and within a week decide that $70 is more reasonable - a 66% drop in a week. Of course, people can't make up their minds whether Bitcoin is a scam or if it's the future of humanity, so the price goes haywire and we see regular gains and drops of 10/20/30%.

It's November 2013. Bitcoin is not a scam. Clearly, because it's now worth $200. Or is it worth $650? No, it's worth $550. Now it's $700. Nope, $1,100. Now it's $950. 

Now it's December and it's $1,100 again. But what the hell is going on, MtGox won't let me log in despite me not sleeping and spending the last 15 hours through the night trying. Now I'm late for work and I've lost 20% of my money, even though I've actually gained 1000% this year, I'm only bothered about losing 20% of what I had a day ago, just like literally everyone else.

It's 2014. It's also most of 2015. The entirety of both years. Bitcoin is dead. Never coming back. We're down to $200. Mining still makes me the same $2-3/day that it ever has, even though the 1BTC/day from 2011 is now worth $200+/day. I give up. Everyone else gives up after buying these new things called shitcoins. I forget, not bothering to sell what I had left as it's barely enough to buy a small used car. 

It's 2016 and apparently Bitcoin has tripled since I last looked at it. What. You what. What. Everyone now wants Ethereums. It's like Bitcoin, but it'll fit on my hard drive. Everyone's shitcoins have disappeared. The however many thousands of Doggo coins I mined before I quit have disappeared along with the exchange. Ethereums are bringing out these new shitcoins that actually do something, like Golem, which is like Seti@home but will eventually literally do everything and generate an income for you. Great! Ethereum shitcoins are not called shitcoins. The world of cryptocurrency is very different to how i remember it. I swap half my BTC for ETH and then 80% of that for various tokens.

It's 2017. Nothing bad is happening. Everyone is investing in ICOs for non-shitcoins. Everyone's making $2k/day just trading. Everyone's also making $500-2k/day just holding. Everyone has bitcoin and ether, as well as a tonne of ERC-20 tokens. Some people also have Bitconnect which seems very much like the HYIPs I used to join during my PTC/PTS days as a teenager. Seems like a scam, no good. Ethereum has several 20-30% drops throughout the year. Seems normal, I'm no longer phased after 2013. Everyone in my office is interested. They all discuss it at $10, but ask me about investing $15k when the price hits $300. Finally, they enter at $600 and no one does any work for the rest of the year. We just talk crypto.

It's the second half of 2017. I make more on crypto in one day than at my day job in a month. Literally everything is going up. No one considers that it'll ever drop again. I'm like: ""🤷‍♂️ Looks pretty normal to me, but I better sell some soon else..""...

Actually, it's January to April 2018. New York bonuses or Chinese New year or some seemingly random event makes everyone sell literally everything. Everyone had put all their bitcoin into ether, and then all their ether into ICOs. What was once 25BTC was now 400,000,000 various ERC-20 tokens, or kittens, worth around $200. Not only did everyone sell their tokens, causing them to crash, but everyone sold everything else, making everything else crash. Crashception. Every second word on reddit is ""crash"".

Ether went from $1,200 to $75 in a year or so. Declared dead by everyone.

It's 2018-2020. I'm like, well, not sure. Probably will repeat the cycle of dips, moons and crashes, but probably should have sold. How many Deloreans could I have bought? Better not check my ""How many Deloreans I can afford if I traded all of my cryptos for deloreans.xlsx"" spreadsheet. My heart and soul must be dead. I have felt no emotion or regret during the crash. 2013 had used up all of that. All of my colleagues are bored and stop talking about crypto. Despite what they said, they weren't interested in the tech, only the money. One buys a folding phone for $1,500 with what was once $10k of Galaxy Ripple chocolate bars, I think. I buy more Ether, deciding to not exchange any for other tokens. From now on, only BTC and ETH for me. I buy some occasionally, but not as much as I should. I pretty much leave crypto will the expectation that we'll just repeat it all again in a few years.

It's 2021, things are batshit insane again. Already?Woopdedoo. Everyone's talking to me about crypto. Fgs. I just decided to try the real stock market where people cry over a 3% crash. Everyone is jumping back in. What is defi and nft? Are cryptokitties nft? Is my kitty still alive? Who knows. Give it 5 years and there'll be a yet another new equivalent to shitcoins.

Bitcoin drops by $10k in January, I'm like, meh. I play with Coinbase Earn and shortly make a mint.

It's the present: Bitcoin drops another 10k in February, even though it's still higher than the last drop. I'm like, meh. Everyone panics. For some reason I decide to write a 20 word reddit post and it turns into whatever the hell I'm writing now for whatever point I'm trying to make. Something about not declaring it dead over a $10k drop when we're still up by $20k this year.

It's mid 2021. Bitconnect is back and they want your doge. Bitcoin hits $80k but crashes by 20% down to $64k. The world is on fire and shit is hitting the CPU fan. It crashes by another $5k before hitting $85k. Ether was $4k but now deemed dead because it's only $2k. Soon it'll be $5k. Elon tweeted about doge being the national currency of Mars. It's a joke, but now doge is $42 and I remember that old exchange that vanished with probably $420,000,000 worth of my doge, and 50 LTC. Twelve seconds later it's back to $0.10. Everyone is mad because it is now only worth double of what it was worth yesterday, even though it is down from ,12 seconds ago.

It's every other year from now until the end of eternity.. Everything crashed by 50% overnight. Now it costs me 250 satoshis or less for my latte. Ether is $1^26 or something and no one knows what is happening anymore. The price went so high because 10 billion people on Earth use it daily, either directly or because their car automatically pays for tolls on the Ethereum network with that project from Oaken Innovations that hasn't been updated in years, that now no exchange can display it correctly or something. Everyone is now an NZT or NFT or POS or some other acronym. While I'm working, my phone earns me 0.2 GLM, my fridge earns me 4 MYST, my washing machine earns me a few E-DOGE, all while I process medical simulations and allow some family in China to access wikipedia without their government seeing. My family on Mars send me some DOGE to keep me afloat. Ripple is still being investigated by the SEC while their owners siphon another $100m each year. The price of all cryptos goes 10x every other year but it's all dead when it drops 10-20%.

It's the end of this post. I've no idea what's going on. Has the crash reverted in the time that I've written this? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I lost today? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I gained since the start of the year? I look at the price of literally every crypto and see a 10% drop after an unlimited % gain since inception and several hundred percent just this year or so.

Its the end of the end of this post. I consider how to end it, but instead have two endings. Things don't make sense. I consider changing the title to reflect my original intention of pointing out how a 10-20% drop is pretty much to be expected with crypto and that by looking at the bigger picture, you won't even see this dip on a chart next year. Instead, I do whatever I am doing now. I give up and decide to post this so I can use the reddit app to check if anyone has posted anything meaningful about NuCypher, even though I expect the usual pump posts.",2021-02-23 19:10:37

He explained that cryptocurrencies are not like securities and cannot be regulated with the same policies, noting that to do so would drive innovation offshore.**

>“These aren’t just stocks. It’s something very different. It’s a medium of exchange that, if adopted more widely, could facilitate a lot of economic activities and a lot of innovation within the United States of America.”

>“What you’ll see is the flight of innovation, and investments related to innovation, to offshore locations around the globe.”

> ""You are trying to adopt many-decades-old regulatory policies to a completely new form of exchange — one that, by the way, values very highly the privacy of those who exchange in it.”

> “If what you’re going do is take away that value by requiring that all of it be registered and publicly disclosed by giving the federal government the ability to peer into it, you’re going to stifle innovation, you’re going to make a lot of people upset, and you’re going to make Americans poorer.”

The facts are: nobody knows what will happen. The only thing we know is that things went up like crazy for half a year, then crashed pretty hard in May and have been going sideways ever since. The market could continue to go sideways for months, or it could shoot back up or completely crash in an hour.

This sub is a great source of entertainment and for crypto news, it is an awful source of advice.

* SBF to be investigated in the course of the bankruptcy
* Sam Bankman-Fried's hedge fund lent billions to... Sam Bankman-Fried (Paper Bird is his entity), so that's at least part of the answer of where the money went
* ~~FTX says the ""fair value"" of all the crypto (non stablecoins) that FTX international holds is a mere $659! (personal note: they do have 1$ bill in stable)~~ This was a mistake, my bad. Seems like the chart is in thousands of dollars, so they have 659,000$.
* ""The FTX Group did not maintain centralized control of its cash. Cash management procedural failures included the absence of an accurate list of bank accounts and account signatories""
* This is mad stuff  ""I do not believe it appropriate for stakeholders or the Court to rely on the audited financial statements as a reliable indication""  ""The Debtors have been unable to prepare a complete list of who worked for the FTX Group as of the Petition Date""
* ""In the Bahamas, I understand that corporate funds of the FTX Group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisors""

* Ryan Salame: $55m

My take - IT could be FTX just used Alameda as a cover story, quite possible these guys were not doing any trading and just stealing customer funds. Having Alameda was a good cover story for them to use the money.

The bot was initially designed to buy Bitcoin when Elon Musk tweets about, regardless of the sentiment of the tweet. I have shared it with some smaller communities, and there was some great feedback on it regarding the main concern - what if Elon tweets: ""Bitcoin is too high imo"" and the bot buys at the wrong time.

So I found an API that would help me analyse the tweet sentiment, and integrated this into the code. The bot will now only buy Bitcoin when Elon Tweets, if the sentiment of his tweet is positive.

I have tested the functionality and the bot is quite stable, but I haven't tested how profitable (if at all) it would actually be, so if you're interested in testing it, please share the results with us! :)

The bot was built mostly for fun, and I wouldn't encourage you to trade with it on a live account! But if you want to have some fun with it and try it out on a demo account, here you go:

This is good in theory, the SEC is protecting investors by giving a fine to fraudsters. But if you take even one second to go over the numbers he still wins.

Jake Paul netted millions from cryptozoo alone and his coworkers made just as much. His other scam projects such as DINK DOINK was another rug pull he cashed in on. If he is profiting 6x or more than his fine it’s really no punishment whatsoever, hardly a slap on the wrist.

The only real punishment was that it hurts his reputation. But the real issue I have with this is that tells other potential scammers that they have the green light. They can go ahead and commit mass fraud because at the end of the day you just have to pay a little tax on your profits. And retail investors lose again.

The SEC can’t seem to make one right move in the crypto world but I can’t even blame them fully because of all the influencers and celebrities are the ones doing it in the first place.

It has the power to tax, the strongest network of alliances and the most powerful military. Yes, it has printed a lot of dollars since 2008, but it also has [taken steps](https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2013/march/federal-reserve-interest-balances-reserves/) to lower the speed at which those dollars circulate.

Yes, rates of price inflation are likely to be higher for the next two years or so, but already some of the immediate inflationary pressures are abating; lumber prices, for instance, are now [plummeting](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-11/lumber-prices-post-biggest-ever-weekly-drop-with-buyers-balking?sref=EP6bV7CS). Over a 10-year time horizon, the U.S. government can [borrow](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us) at a near-zero real rate of interest, hardly a sign of a doomed empire.

Nor is the U.S. government about to go broke or on the brink of resorting to hyperinflation. The U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio may well hit 200%, but the poorer and smaller nation of Japan is doing OK with similar debt levels. Keep in mind that national wealth, while difficult to estimate, may run as much as six to eight times higher than GDP. So a 200% debt-to-income ratio could mean a debt-to-wealth ratio as low as 25%. That’s hardly the end of the world. Think of how comfortable you’d be if you paid off “only” 75% of your mortgage.

If anything, crypto is more likely to hurt the currencies of countries that are doing very poorly, [such as Venezuela](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-adoption-venezuela-research).

--------------------

What benefit is there to having such a low number of employees? Lower costs yes but with the money they control and need to invest surely it would make sense for them to have more than just 13 employees doing this? 

Or is it because it's easier for them to conceal fraud when there's only a handful of people being exposed to it and most of them have a large interest in keeping the fraud going.

Tether has just under $30bn in commercial paper ([source](https://www.ft.com/content/342966af-98dc-4b48-b997-38c00804270a)) which makes it one of the largest US commerical paper market investors in the entire world alongside the likes of Vanguard (17600 employees) and BlackRock (16500 employees). **THIRTEEN EMPLOYEES EVALUATING THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF NEARLY 30BN IN COMMERCIAL PAPER LOANS AND WITHOUT THE OVERSIGHT OF AUDITING.**

A ""white hat hacker"", a hacker with good intentions, came across a major vulnerability and instead of exploiting it, he notified the team at Coinbase. Coinbase was able to fix the vulnerability in no time and publicly thanked the hacker.

&#x200B;

**Coinbase white hat hacker**

The hacker in question is known on social media as ""Tree of Alpha. On Twitter a few days ago, he let it be known that he wanted to get in touch with Coinbase's dev team urgently. As it turns out, he was on to something important.

Just a few hours later, Coinbase announced that they had temporarily suspended all trading on the Advanced Trading platform under the guise of ""technical problems. Moments later, the problems had been resolved, Tree of Alpha itself confirmed.

According to Tree of Alpha, the problems could have potentially caused a real catastrophe for Coinbase and the rest of the crypto industry. Indeed, the vulnerability allowed malicious parties to manipulate all Coinbase order books with fake prices. Of course, the consequences of such an exploit would have been huge, not only for the crypto exchange, but for the overall crypto industry.

&#x200B;

**Coinbase CEO Brian Armstong**

Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, has since publicly thanked Tree of Alpha. According to him, the hacker's willingness to warn Coinbase instead of exploiting the vulnerability himself once again shows what the crypto community really stands for. It is unknown if Tree of Alpha received a reward for his achievements. This is often the case within the crypto industry.

Now I don't know what to do with all this ETH. It's worth approximately 250 millions USD, which is not bad, if you ask me. Should I stake it all and get the 4% rewards? This way I would get passive income, something like 10 millions USD/year, which is theoritically enough for my family to live a comfortable life. 

Also, by staking, I would be contributing to the security of the blockchain, which is a big plus for me - I wanna do my part!

But is this the best course of action for me?

I also thought about getting into liquidity pools, **but I am afraid of smart contract risks**. What if I put all my ETH into a LP on Solana, and then some asshole comes and drain the contract? I worked very hard for this ETH, that would suck. And there's also the risk of impermanent loss - what if my ETH on Solana decoupled from the ETH on mainnet?

I hope in the coming years that the gas fees will be reduced to a fraction of a cent - kind of like Harmony’s right now at their current transaction load. That, or more developers begin looking at building on networks with lower gas fees as their TVL grows, though none are anywhere close to Ethereum’s at the moment.

How does everyone feel about gas at the moment, and where we will be a year or two later? All the smaller networks are starved for apps, especially games right now :/

*I guess my main point was that many of the more desirable or attractive projects or games (current and upcoming) are housed on L1 and are what currently draws new user interest, only for them to be turned away by the gas fees that first-timers are almost certainly going to be taken aback by.

I always see these posts a lot, but for some reason more in the past few days:

*""what are the best coins under $X?""*

And sure, it looks like that makes sense - Bitcoin (BTC) is super expensive already, while a coin like BitTorrent (BTT) is available for less than one cent! If you buy some now and they become as expensive as Bitcoin you will be rich! Bitcoin also used to be cheap! Right?

Lol, nah, wrong, obviously. The thing is: coin price doesn't matter. At all. Because it is strongly affected by how many coins are in circulation. There are currently about 18,700,000 BTC in circulation, there will never be more than 21,000,000. But there are 660,000,000,000 BTT at the moment and there will be 990,000,000,000 at some point. The important figure is the market cap, which is

**Market Cap =  Circulating Supply  X Coin Price**

So, for example, for BTC it would be  49,500 X 18,700,000, about 920 billion USD. So if we imagine BitTorrent becoming just as big as Bitcoin, how much would a single coin be worth? $1.38. So can't a single BTT be worth thousands of dollars, like BTC is? No, absolutely not. If 1 BTT would be worth 49,500, as 1 BTC currently is, its market cap once all the coins are in circulation would be almost 50,000,000,000,000,000. 50 quadrillion, or 50,000 trillion. The total amount of wealth in the world is about 300 trillion.

**tl;dr:** Coin price is NOT a good indicator how much a coin can still grow. Check the market cap and compare it to other coins to see how much a coin would need to grow to be as big as another coin. [The Coin Perspective](https://thecoinperspective.com) is a great website to make these comparisons. Also remember that you can buy fractions of a coin, like 0.001 BTC and don't have to buy a whole one.",2021-05-15 15:08:46

If you don’t know what “market cap” means and you’re trying to get in early on “moonshots,” I’m begging you to take 2 minutes to read.

Market capitalization is the total value of all members of an asset. Just circulating supply * price. (Edited note: worth mentioning that you should be using the average price over different platforms. THAT BEING SAID: if the platform you’re looking at shows a price that would imply a market cap in the quadrillions, then that DOES mean the price is too high there. Even though the market cap calculated by that price wouldn’t be an accurate measurement of the combined value of the coin, it IS a good indicator of whether or not it will actually be able to maintain that price. If it’s not an accurate price, arbitrage is going to correct the price soon enough.) 

What does it tell us? It lets us know how much ~~money~~ value is attributed to it, and how it compares to other coins.


Take SHIB for an example. It has a circulating supply of **400 trillion tokens,** so at its price of 0.003¢, it has a market cap of nearly $12 BILLION. That’s 1/5 of doge’s cap of $60B, and it is therefore already one of the largest cryptocurrencies out there.

At 10¢, the market cap would be $40 trillion, double the US annual GDP. It will not hit 10¢. It will not hit 1¢z It will not hit 0.1¢. It MIGHT hit 0.01¢ because of how the market has been working lately, but those other targets are just mathematically far too high.

(Another edited note: when I say reach that price, I meant having a stable price that high on most/all trading platforms. Thanks to those of you who corrected me on that)

The creators want you to see all those zeros in front of the price and assume buying it would be “getting in early.” Don’t let them fool you. You are not getting in early by buying a coin with a $12B market cap. You are almost certainly very very very late.

DYOR. Please.

Edit:

A lot of people are hung up on “how much money is in it.” I didn’t mean it in terms of principal investment, I meant it in terms of valuation. I have a lot of BAT that I bought at 30 cents. I don’t value it as if it were the 30 cents per token that I bought it at, because I know I can just sell at the market price if I need to.

The argument that it would crash if everyone tired to sell at once is fallacious. It’s valued at what it is and it ISN’T crashing to nothing from everyone selling at once because people aren’t trying to all sell at once. They would rather have the BAT than the $1.30. If they didn’t, they would have sold already.

Edit 2:

Think I came off wrong here. Not a financial expert, that much is obvious. I know that things can crash from everyone selling, I was trying to say that everyone selling is BECAUSE they value the coin’s value in fiat/btc/eth/whatever less than they do the coin.

Second, I know there are flaws in it, as it can’t be instantly converted. I’m not trying to make it out to be some perfect metric of value. My intentions here are solely to tell people that their millions of scamcoin that they bought for $10 probably is not going to make them a 9 figure crypto whale.

270,EXPLANATION: The recent crash was probably due to margin accounts having a cascading crash on Binance.,8702,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mt5odv/explanation_the_recent_crash_was_probably_due_to/,1938,"Degenerates on Binance with up to 150x leverage (borrowing Tethers to buy crypto) have been building up their margin account balances to big numbers, and when they make money, they double down, and build even bigger positions. Because they're degenerates.

But when the price dips below a certain point, some degenerates who have these margin accounts are suddenly below their maintenance limits, and they get liquidated. When they get liquidated, Binance will sell your crypto for Tether, and you are left with little to nothing.

So what happened? Crypto got sold, and Tether got bought. Because Crypto got sold, the price drops, which triggers more accounts, who thought they were safe, to dip below their margin maintenance requirements.

This creates a feedback cycle which basically ends in the liquidation of all the margin accounts. It all ends in a very fast, cascading crash like we just saw.

The bad news is the price is lower, but there's a silver lining. The good news is the market is in a healthier position after this. Most of the unsustainable degenerate margin accounts are probably gone. If we go up to $60k in the next week, it's not because of borrowing (as much). Going forward, at least for the near term, another event like this is not very likely.

The price we see right now could be thought of as being closer to the ""real"" price which we would have had without the degenerates.

TLDR: Fuck Binance

And fuck the rest of the exchanges with 150x leverage bullshit

EDIT: Some people wanted more evidence to support this theory, so I suggest you look at the price differences between the exchanges (Binance vs. Coinbase, for instance) during the crash. You'll notice the exchange with leverage was significantly lower in price, which suggests bots were arbitraging Coinbase down to match it. Additionally, note the Tether price during the crash, which went up to $1.05.

Because if the laws pass, it will give her the power to regulate the entire crypto industry. Yellen is the person behind White House's push to favor Sen. Warner's amendment over others. While the entire crypto community has been publicly tying to educate Senators on these laws, she has been making calls behind closed doors trying to arm twist the Senators into bringing in these draconian regulations. ""Shadowy""

As it turns out she has also been getting paid by the banks she is supposed to regulate. And she is brining in regulation that kills decentralised competitors to banks, who have so far enjoyed near monopoly when it comes to controlling people's finances. 

As Treasury Secretary, she is paid by the US Government to regulate banks - a role that requires the highest standards of ethics and moral turpitude. But she has collected $7m from the same banks that she regulates! Including Citi, Citadel Securities etc. How, without impartiality, can she regulate these banks that are paying her millions of dollars in speaking fees?

Imo - public officials paid by the government should not be collecting millions from the same entities they regulate. This is nothing but grift. While it is not per se criminal, because she was doing it when she was not a Govt official, but nevertheless these payments were received between her 2 terms as Treasury Secretary. 

The ethical thing for her was to not accept the role of Treasury Secretary in the new Biden Administration, because she was aware she had been paid by the banks she is supposed to regulate. But despite all this, she took up the job. clearly indicating her lack of morals and ethics. 

She really needs to STEP DOWN. The crypto community must unite to get such greedy grifters out of public policy for good, if we need to have a fair chance at our decentralised future.",2021-08-08 11:39:17

People are spreading the false narrative as if he has moved the entire supply of reserves to BTC, which is far away from whats going on.
They have just been making small purchases over time. They literally bought like 2 BTC in the end of Dec. Peanuts for a country.


A 2% allocation in a risky asset class is not a gamble by any means. It is a decent risk reward play for individuals, and countries as well. 

If you consult with a financial advisor, they may suggest a portfolio allocation of 2% towards emerging asset classes like crypto. Infact, thats what Fidelity suggests as well. [Recently, they added a 2% BTC allocation to their flagship All in one Balanced / Growth funds](https://www.investmentexecutive.com/news/products/fidelity-to-add-bitcoin-exposure-to-portfolio-funds/). These are mom and pop funds that are held mostly by conservative investors. 

Its been around a year since El Salvador announced their Bitcoin Law and around 6 months since it went active. In this period, they have allocated a small portion of their reserves towards BTC. This is not a gamble, but a solid  and well planned asset allocation strategy. Meanwhile, they have already started mining BTC and over time, this industry has the potential to add to their GDP. 


What did people think bitcoin/crypto adoption would be like, one fine day every country across the world will just start accepting BTC out of the blue? Just like that it would become legal tender without any struggle? 

These are small steps and it will be risky. Nothing happened overnight, let alone moving from USD to a decentralised currency like Bitcoin.

Its shameful that people here want adoption of BTC and crypto, but the first time a large sovereign power has tried to adopt BTC, the same people who want crypto adoption go out of their way to attack them with baseless allegations.

But it's at these times gains are made. Not by trading (for some, sure) but by studying and planning your strategy. Now it's time for you to do your research on which coins you believe in and align your bags accordingly. 

**It's true what they say, ""Time in the market, beats timing the market""**. So don't over-leverage, don't sell high or on the way down, and stick to projects/coins you believe in. If you believe in crypto, your goal is to still be in this game years down the road. 

And it's way more profitable than jumping ship from coin to coin depending on what's pumping. Plus you will learn a lot along the way.

Once you've aligned your bags accordingly, all you need to do is to lay in a coma, trust your intuition and try to keep yourself from refreshing prices 24/7. 

This part is difficult for all of us to do, but it's important. Doing this is a lot easier if you have hobbies or things you're passionate about outside crypto.

Shib took off yes, don’t misunderstand me — I’m perfectly happy with that. But the gamble those holders took **then** is way underestimated **today** now that everyone knows of it. 

The dozens of other coins that fucked people hard — don’t make for as good of a one year equation. I took the liberty of going through the **most popular** moonshots posts from a year ago.. to bring you some examples:

- BEYOND PROTOCOL - “bigger than Bitcoin and ETH combined” is the slogan and it was the most popular post in the last year, $1000 a year ago would be worth $647 today 

- BabyKrypto - only 47 days old but if you bought $1000 worth when they started advertising it on Moonshots, you’d have $125 today 

- $1000 in SHIBAFEVER would have gotten you 77 million coins just a week ago, worth $153 today 

After this we started getting into rebase tokens where the “price” doesn’t move they just “adjust” the tokens that you hold, but you can’t sell either so I’d say $1000 into those burned up pretty quickly. 

- There’s also Floki Jr, Floki New York, Micro Shiba and Chopper Inu, Catch Doge, Doge back, and Robo Doge that I can’t even find accurate information on.. but I’m guessing those didn’t make many crypto millionaires. 

Anyway, I’m seeing a lot of posts asking how to jump on a newly listed coin first and where to find them, and I just wanted to say .. I don’t even think those that have held SHIB for a year give themselves enough credit for how big a leap they took. This style of investing breeds a lot more losers than winners, and winners rarely stop there and cash out — they’re on the hunt for the next opportunity to lose money.

316,Everyone always says “DYOR” but never shows you how to DYOR. Here’s a comprehensive guide to doing your own research in the crypto space.,7960,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owihb6/everyone_always_says_dyor_but_never_shows_you_how/,892,"## 1) Initial information gathering and filtering

Once I identify something that looks like a good potential investment, I first go to the CoinMarketCap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer.

- Critically evaluate the website. This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like ""Web 4.0"" or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past.

- Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc

- Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account?

- Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?


## 2) Fill out an Investment Checklist

I have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:

- What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?

- What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?

- Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?

- What current product exists?

- How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?

- What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?


## 3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple

A simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do:

- Metcalfe's Law which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic.

- Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply.

- If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price.

Once you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.

Once you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how ""smart money"" does it.

## Think about your portfolio allocation

You should think first in broad terms how you allocate between ""safe"" and ""speculative"" cryptos. For new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC and ETH. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.

You should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:

- Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum
- Smart contracts platform segment - Ethereum, Polkadot, ALGO, Solana …etc
- Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash …etc
- Finance/Bank settlement segment - Stellar ...etc
- Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain ...etc
- Promising/Innovative Tech segment: NANO, ADA, Tezos ...etc

You should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a techie who loves the technology behind a coin, invest in that.


## Think of your ""circle of competence""

This is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain will achieve adoption? 

This where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every category and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well.


## Continually educate yourself about the technology and markets

If you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.

For starters how can the devs shut down the blockchain because of a glitch then call the platform decentralised? Do you think crypto could of ever come this far if satoshi shut down btc for repairs? Absolute nonsense.

Then there was the discovery of a hidden 12 million coins which wasint disclosed to any investor. 12,000,000× £160 (roughly at the moment)= £1,920,000,000 is a lot of money to hide for no specific reason.

320,A Beginner's Guide to Cryptocurrency Wallets,7897,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lkkm0v/a_beginners_guide_to_cryptocurrency_wallets/,1012,"A cryptocurrency wallet is basically a software that enables you to track, send and receive coins through the blockchain like a bank account. Every wallet has a public key and a private key, but we'll get back to this later. But first...

# Why do you need a wallet?

There's an old saying in Tennessee that says: **""Not your keys, not your coins.""** What it actually means is that if you keep your cryptocurrencies on an exchange (such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken), you don't actually own those coins, because you don't have the keys to the related wallet. You gain access to those wallets by logging into these exchanges, but your account can - theoretically - be deleted in the blink of an eye, or the exchange can get hacked, attacked, etc. And with it, your funds can disappear forever. If you want to learn more about this, make sure to look up Mt. Gox's hacking. It is an unfortunate event, but one that puts you on guard. 

So you already know that you need to own your keys in order to own your coins. **But what are these keys?**

Your **public key** is what identifies your account on the network. Think of it as your email address, because when someone wants to send you cryptocurrency, they will send it to this address. 

Your **private key** is a string of 64 characters that can be generated from a 12-word seed phrase. It basically serves as the password of your account. It is used to sign transactions and to prove that you own the related public key. 

See, it's not that complicated, is it?

# About wallet types

There are 4 types of wallets that you should be using. Ideally, you can pick the one that fits your crypto habits the most. You should avoid using Web wallets. As always, if you can, please pick the safest wallet type in order to minimize the risk of losing your cryptos. 

**Hardware / Offline / Cold Wallet** \- an offline storage device (e.g. hard disk, USB stick). You might've heard the names Ledger or Trezor, these are the 2 biggest brands at the moment. The ledger supports over 1200 cryptocurrencies, while Trezor supports over a thousand. It is also the most secure way to store your cryptocurrencies. 

**Mobile Wallet** \- applications that are installable on your mobile phone. Beware that even though an app can hold crypto, it doesn't mean it is NOT custodial. (e.g. Coinbase has a mobile app, but it is custodial, meaning that they control your coins.) Exodus or Atomic mobile apps are recommended if you decide to create a mobile wallet.

**Desktop Wallet** \- wallets that are installable on different desktops and are compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Your keys are stored on your computer, and you can use this wallet even when you're offline. Note: Desktop wallets tend to be more advanced than mobile wallets, and usually come with more technically complicated features that can increase privacy or allow for more flexibility when it comes to signing transactions.

**Paper wallet** \- a paper wallet is essentially a piece of paper including your public and private key, or a QR code (so that you can quickly scan them and add the keys to a software wallet to make a transaction). It's a really safe way to store your cryptos because your keys are not connected to any servers. The only way someone can steal your cryptos is if they steal this paper.

# The Best Hardware Wallets

**Ledger Nano (S and X)** \- The most popular hardware wallet brand in the world, currently sells 2 different sticks. The S is the cheaper alternative, but if you handle transactions between multiple cryptocurrencies frequently, the larger storage of the Nano X should be more convenient. The Nano X also has Bluetooth 5.0 support. You can read more about Ledgers on their website. 

Beware that **Ledger was targeted by a cyberattack that led to a data breach** in July 2020. A larger subset of detailed information has been leaked, approximately 272,000 detailed information such as postal address, last name, first name, and telephone number of our customers. However, not a single coin was stolen as hackers didn't gain access to private keys. Please keep this in mind when making your decision. 

**Trezor (One and Model T)** \- Trezor is the other popular hardware wallet brand. The Trezor One is the cheaper alternative ($59), while the Model T is more expensive but comes with extended functionality and additionally supports cryptocurrencies such as ADA, XMR, XTZ, etc.

Despite the security of hardware devices themselves, **the weakest link is always the people using them.** If possible, avoid buying used hardware wallets, even though both Trezor and Ledger have security measures to avoid the attempt of installing malwares.

# The Best Desktop Wallets

**Exodus** \- a very user-friendly and easy to understand, reliable wallet. As of now, it is probably the most popular desktop wallet. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux as well. 

**Atomic** \- it is also a user-friendly and reliable wallet. Atomic supports 500+ assets and allows staking various cryptocurrencies. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Of course, there are several other reliable desktop wallets, but these two proved to be the most user-friendly and easy to use wallets so far. As always, please DYOR!

**If you decide to go with a mobile wallet** (instead of a paper, hardware, or a desktop wallet), Exodus or Atomic are both available on iOS and Android. Please avoid installing 10+ crypto wallet applications on your phone, because you'll make it impossible to keep track of your keys and passwords eventually.

Last piece of advice: always be cautious and double-check everything. Keep your devices malware-free, and don't click on anything suspicious (such as emails from ""Binnance"", crazy bonus links from ""Coimbase"", etc.)

So if you head on over to a website called [https://tokenJenny.one](https://tokenJenny.one) then you are able to create your own tokens on the Harmony ONE network. It will cost a little ONE in gas to mint the crypto I used [https://cryptoroyale.one](https://cryptoroyale.one) to make some ROY sent it to MetaMask and then trade that for ONE in [https://viperswap.one](https://viperswap.one)  Done now I have made my first crypto and I add it to ViperSwap so I can add liquidity. With this first crypto I added liquidity in ONE at a 1 to 1 basis then I used 0.01 or 0.001 ONE at a time to buy my crypto for roughly 100 transactions this ups the price a little and so I leave the coin and over about 2 weeks the market brings it up. I sell a little to recover all that had gone to gas and this crashes my crypto to a very low price. Next test is creating coins that add liquidity too each other here's a glimps at them all.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[In doing this I have managed to add about 20 ONE into liquidity of ONE and my KWP coin and now can sell about 250 of KWP at a time, this is what happens when you do sell a little ](https://preview.redd.it/33sse754h0281.png?width=1877&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=52747ce72d9ed0befa1a08adac546579322650c8)

&#x200B;

As you can see I had a lot of fun creating all of these but none of them really did very well so I then thought well I need to start with a better liquidity ratio so I create notbitcoin I then add 0.0001 to 1 ONE and I buy a few transactions of 0.001 ONE getting less and less NBTC each turn, now I have a value better than I had before so I start to add liquidity from the coins I have made making sure to work out the math on the current values as close as can with a small amount and then bang I add Billions in my own cryptos which soar the Liquidity and the value of the new coin I have made. If I sell any of the coins that I have added this will drop the price dramatically due to me being the only owner.  Plus I can only sell about 0.0002 at a time into ONE due to the low amount of liquidity in this coin and even that small sale would crash the value.

&#x200B;

Its crazy to think this is possible and this just shows you anyone can make crypto and make it look like it has a huge amount of value if I now make sure I buy a little every day and not sell for a few months next year this could be the next doge and will basically follow the market. I could start the trend the not crypto's instead of meme coins. Stay safe all hope this educates you that it really is too easy to make a crypto and just as easy to make one that looks amazing. Hope you all have a great weekend.

She called her manager to presumably explain this amazing opportunity, whilst I pulled out a map of some Nano faucets we could go to and test out how amazing Nano is.

Also, they cant use that crypto to buy commodities from other countries either, as these countries could come under risk of sanction themselves, and furthermore high volume crypto-commodity market is also non-existent right now. No country is going to be ready to start accepting say 10m  tonnes of Wheat for Crypto. Such a scenario is not even possible right now given the structure of crypto markets.

That is why it is important for USA to actually build dominance in crypto markets, and yet you have people like Liz spinning up a""crypto is bad"" narrative whenever they get the chance to do    

Being afraid of Russia using crypto to evade sanctions is literally being scared of the boogeyman, especially when CIPS and SPFS offer much more immediate options for them.",2022-03-01 16:26:49
336,"No, Georgia did not pass a bill to teach highschool students about cryptocurrency.",7671,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/myfdax/no_georgia_did_not_pass_a_bill_to_teach/,426,"Someone made a thread with [this article](https://invezz.com/news/2021/03/12/georgia-passes-a-bill-to-teach-high-school-students-about-crypto/) and a very clickbaity title to entice and get reactions and comments from all of you (obviously for Moon farming). It got to the frontpage with about 8k upvotes. If you read the article you will see that:

&#x200B;

1. It's from March 12, not recent.
2. Any ""proposed bill"" needs to be approved by both legislature houses (House of Representatives and Senate). It was only approved on the House of Representatives, so it effectivelly wasn't ""passed"".
3. It's already dead on the Senate [as you can read here: ""Status: Engrossed on March 8 2021 - 50% progression, **died in chamber**](https://legiscan.com/GA/bill/HB681/2021)""
4. The proposed bill intended to add a **16 point Financial Literacy course** to 10th and 11th graders **where one of them was cryptocurrency** [as you can see here.](https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20212022/199139)
5. This is literally in the second paragraph of the original article: *According to the report, the bill aims to amend the current curriculum for 10th and 11th-grade students. The new program would consist of 16 new areas of financial literacy such as cryptocurrency, balancing a checking account, money management, making investments, and completing loan applications, among other traditional subjects.*

&#x200B;

Easy conclusion: Georgia is not teaching students about Crytocurrency. People will upvote whatever makes them feel good even though a simple reading of the article and a small amount of critical thinking would make them at least question the way the headline was written.

338,DeFi Explained: The FULL Guide,7649,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nletmi/defi_explained_the_full_guide/,730,"I've noticed that people in this sub are getting more and more interested in DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications. With this guide I would like to help you getting started with learning the basic fundamentals of DeFi and setting up your wallet and tools. I tried to make this guide as complete as possible.

# Fundamentals

Let's start with some fundamentals first.

# What is Decentralized Finance

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a movement that uses decentralized networks and blockchains to transform traditional financial products into trustless and transparent protocols that work without intermediaries.

Currently, almost all DeFi applications are built on the Ethereum blockchain and Binance Smart Chain (EDIT: Binance Smart Chain is NOT as decentralized as Ethereum and is therefore often labeled as CeDeFi). Like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance have a blockchain that acts as a shared ledger in which digital value is tracked. Rather than a central authority, the participants making up the network control the issuance of ether (or BNB), the network's cryptocurrency, in a decentralized way.

Developers can program applications that can create, store and manage digital assets, also known as tokens, on the blockchain. For this to work, smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) are written and built. The expiration of these contracts and agreements is automatically enforced if the blockchain receives the correct data. You can make complex, irreversible agreements without the need for an intermediary.

Anyone is able to create, adapt, mix, link or build on an existing DeFi product without permission. DeFi protocols are modular, so they can be stacked on top of each other to build an increasingly dense system of interacting parts.

# Wallets

You can download a wallet on a PC, tablet or telephone. With this you can store, send or receive Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Three related concepts determine whether someone has ownership of a certain wallet, these are your digital keys (also called public & private keys), your wallet address and your digital signature.

The most important aspect of a wallet are your digital keys, as they give you access to your wallet. It is important to know that these keys are not stored online on the blockchain but are instead stored independently within the digital wallet itself. Each key consists of both a public key and a private key.

Consider your public key the same as the bank account, which also consists of an address. Your public key works more or less the same. The pin code with which you subsequently gain access to this bank account is then referred to as your private key.

It is very important that you ALWAYS keep your private key to yourself. If someone else has the private key, he / she can send and steal all coins, so keep it safe. With the public key, people can only send coins, so that can't hurt.

Every wallet has a unique code, which we also call the wallet address, which consists of a random letter and number combination that is different for everyone. This address is in fact the name of your wallet and makes it possible for others to transfer cryptocurrencies to you.

Example of just any bitcoin address: 14J5Q7ageKhM3miKd94DX44Kf6b7ko4BZe

Some people assume that your public key is the same as your wallet address. This is not entirely true, but the two are mathematically related.

In order for you to start using DeFi platforms, a browser wallet is needed.

# Coins vs Tokens

A coin runs on its own blockchain, on its own system. It is therefore completely independent. A coin could be compared to a contemporary currency, such as the Dollar. Bitcoin is a coin and has been developed with the aim of serving as a digital payment method and store of value.

Then there are tokens. Tokens by definition do not run on their own blockchain, unlike a coin. They have been added to an already existing blockchain. Tokens can have the same functionality as a coin, although this is not common.

Tokens that are created on the Ethereum network are typically ERC-20 tokens. When we talk about ERC20, we mean the standard that is implemented in certain tokens. ERC20 stands for 'Ethereum Request for Comment 20'. The Binance Smart Chain uses a similar standard, which is the BEP-20 standard.

These standards contains numerous functions that allow any token that has implemented this set of functions to be traded. Examples of those functions are:

* Sending tokens.
* Request balance information from any address.
* List the number of available tokens.

# Layer 2 solutions

Because of high demand, the Ethereum network is getting overloaded. This resulted in very high transaction fees, making it to expensive for small investors to use it's dapps.

This is the main reason why many investors moved to the Binance Smart Chain, which has much lower fees, untill Ethereum 2.0 has been implemented, which is an update that will drastically lower the transaction fees for the network.

However, in order for the Binance Smart Chain to maintain such low transaction fees, it had to sacrifice it's decentralized properties. This resulted in that the Binance Smart Chain is much more centralized and less safe compared to Ethereum.

Fortunately, there are various projects working on Layer 2 solutions to improve both the scalability and speed of the Ethereum network. Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework, chain or protocol that is built on top of an existing blockchain system. By doing so, the mainchain can be unloaded and can solely focus on the safety of the network.

In the case of Ethereum, there are currently 2 sidechains that are pegged to it. These chains are the xDai chain and the Polygon chain. The latter of the sidechains is the most promising Layer 2 solution so far.

By bridging your assets from the Ethereum mainchain to the sidechains, you are able to interact with various dapps that work on these sidechains for almost an negligible amount transaction fees.

# Getting started

Now that you're aware of the fundamentals of DeFi, let's dive into how you can move your assets into the various DeFi protocols.

# Setting up your wallet

In order to move your assets from your wallet on the exchange that you're using to either the Ethereum network, Binance Smart Chain, or Sidechains, you will need a browser wallet that can interact with these DeFi protocols.

I'm currently using MetaMask, so I will use this browser wallet in this guide:

1. Go to the official MetaMask website in your browser ([https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/))
2. Press “Get Chrome extension”, “Chrome Firefox Opera” or “Get Brave Browser”. This of course depends on the browser you want to use at that time.
3. You will now be taken to a page where you can add the extension. With Chrome, for example, there is a button with: + ADD. TO CHROME. Click on the button.
4. A popup appears to confirm this
5. You will now see a MetaMask logo at the top right of the browser. Click this to set up MetaMask.
6. Accept the terms and conditions
7. Create and confirm a new password. Please remember this password.
8. You will now see 12 words. With these words you can always recover your wallet - in combination with the password. Write these words down and keep them safe. Preferably offline - just on paper.
9. Congratulations! You have now installed and configured a MetaMask extension. You can now use the buttons “Buy” and “Send” to buy or send Ether to your wallet. You can now also send Ethereum to the address under “Account 1”.

Your MetaMask wallet will be automatically connected to the Ethereum network. In order to connect your MetaMask to the Binance Smart Chain, Polygon or xDai, follow these steps:

1. Click on the network in the top right corner.
2. Go to settings.
3. Click ""Add network""

In order to setup your wallet for the Binance Smart Chain, enter the following parameters:

Network Name: Smart Chain

New RPC URL: [https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/](https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/)

ChainID: 56

Symbol: BNB

Block Explorer URL: [https://bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com/)

&#x200B;

In order to setup your wallet for the Polygon sidechain, enter the following parameters:

Network Name: Matic Mainnet

New RPC URL: [https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/](https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/)

ChainID: 137

Symbol: MATIC

Block Explorer URL: [https://explorer.matic.network/](https://explorer.matic.network/)

&#x200B;

In order to setup your wallet for the xDai sidechain, enter the following parameters:

Network Name: xDai

New RPC URL: [https://rpc.xdaichain.com/](https://rpc.xdaichain.com/)

Chain ID: 0x64

Symbol: xDai

Block Explorer URL: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet)

# Faucets

In order to be able to perform transactions on these chains, you need to have some of their coins/tokens in your wallet in order to pay for the transaction fees.

* In order to use Ethereum you need Ether
* In order to use Binance Smart Chain you need BNB
* In order to use xDai you need xDai
* In order to use Polygon you need Matic

Luckily you can get small amounts of the currencies for free from so called faucets.

A faucet is an app or a website that distributes small amounts of cryptocurrencies. They’re given the name “faucets'' because the rewards are small, just like small drops of water dripping from a leaky faucet.

However, in the case of crypto faucets, tiny amounts of free or earned cryptocurrency are sent to a user’s wallet. In order to get free crypto, users need to complete tasks as simple as viewing ads, watching product videos, completing quizzes, clicking links (be careful!) or completing a captcha.

You can use the following faucets to receive small amounts of crypto:

* xDai: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet)
* Matic: [https://matic.supply](https://matic.supply)

Unfortunately. I wasn't able to find any faucets for Ether or BNB.

# Sending crypto from the exchange to MetaMask

In order to receive send your assets to MetaMask wallet, you need to fill in the correct address. This is probably straight forward for most of you, but please make sure to quadruple check you're MetaMask wallet address before sending your tokens from the exchange to your address.

When you're sending tokens from Binance, it will ask if you want to send them as BEP20 or ERC20 tokens. Please choose the correct one! Sending BEP20 tokens to your Ethereum address can result in a loss or they end up in your Binance Smart Chain wallet.

# Bridging: An important step!

Please notice that you can't send your tokens directly from the exchange to sidechains such as xDai or Polygon! You need to send them first to the Ethereum network (as they are both sidechains pegged to the Ethereum blockchain). Once received, you can bridge them to xDai or Polygon by using the following links:

* [https://bridge.xdaichain.com/](https://bridge.xdaichain.com/)
* [https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)

Keep in mind that for during the bridging, Ethereum transactions fees have to be paid. After the bridging, you play by the rules of the sidechain (which means cheap transactions).

# I can't find my tokens in my wallet!

If you can't find your tokens back in your wallet after sending them from the exchange, you can follow these steps:

* Check the transaction record, is the transaction completed?
* Make sure you look at the right network. Your MetaMask wallet might be connected to the Binance Smart Chain network, hence not showing your assets.
* Add the contract address of your token to the wallet. You can find the address of your token via [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/) (Ethereum) or [https://bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com/yieldfarms) (Binance Smart Chain). The token address can then be copied in to the MetaMask wallet by clicking on add custom token.

# Setting up your dashboard

To make things a bit more clear, I would advice you to use the DeFi dashboard [Zapper.fi](https://zapper.fi/). Zapper is an interesting platform that lets you quickly and easily deploy and manage your DeFi positions within a single interface. It is a DeFi portfolio management dashboard that helps you stay on top of your portfolio, liquidity pools, and liquidity mining positions.

Zapper supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, xDai and Polygon. In order to connect to the right network, you must first connect your MetaMask to the network you want zapper to connect to. By clicking in the top right corner of your MetaMask wallet you can connect to the network you want Zapper to manage for you.

The first tab of Zapper, shows an overview of your account. It shows the value of your assets in your MetaMask wallet and how your deployed assets are performing in the DeFi protocols (if you deployed any already).

In order to reduce gas fees, Zapper has several features that can ""Zap"" your assets fast and ""cheap"" in order to:

* Start providing liquidity in a pool.
* Swap tokens.
* Bridge your tokens from one network to another.

Zapper also keeps track of the estimated APY's (Annual Percentage Yield) of the various pools from different DeFi protocols as well as farming opportunities.

# A list of DeFi protocols

Before wrapping this post up, I want to share the following website: [https://defipulse.com/](https://defipulse.com/)

DeFi Pulse records the top performing DeFi protocols on the Ethereum main chain as well as their TVL (total locked value) and ranks them accordingly. This page is really worth checking out as it can help you to pick the right protocols to deploy your assets in.

In order to monitor the DeFi space of Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and xDai I like to use [https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/defi](https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/defi) and [https://defiprime.com/#defi\_projects](https://defiprime.com/#defi_projects). However, If you use other resources in order to find the right dapp, let me know!

# That's it for this guide!

I really do hope that this guide helps you to get started on your DeFi adventure.If I missed something or whatever let me know so I can change it.

EDIT 1: All right, there’s some confusion here whether Binance Smart Chain is decentralized or not. It’s NOT decentralized. The Binance Smart Chain is a fork of the Ethereum blockchain that sacrificed it’s safety and decentralized aspect in order to maintain low transaction fees and higher scalability!

339,What happened to the $100k BTC by the end of the year prediction everyone was saying?,7631,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r8djp9/what_happened_to_the_100k_btc_by_the_end_of_the/,3418,"A few months ago it seemed like everyone influential in crypto was predicting $100k BTC by the end of the year. However, it doesn't look like that's going to happen with the state of the market at the moment. It would take something absolutely miraculous to essentially double BTC's market cap by the end of the year. This confirms three things to me:

1.) It seems like many crypto investors, especially the influential onces are still way too optimistic and everything they say should be taken with a grain of salt. 

2.) The ""so called"" experts that keep being asked for predictions have no idea what they're talking about, just pulling random predictions out of their behind.

3.) Technical analysis in crypto can only tell you so much. Essentially, everybody (including the ""experts"") knows shit about fuck, and you're much better doing your own research than investing based on what these bozos say. 

**TLDR:** DYOR",2021-12-04 00:51:58
340,The most important piece of regulation on cryptocurrencies in the world thus far has arrived: I read through all 405 pages of the “Proposal for EU Regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets” so you don’t have to. Here are my conclusions.,7624,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r218s7/the_most_important_piece_of_regulation_on/,1776,"# I present to you, the most important regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies so far: ""Proposal for a Regulation Of The European Parliament and of The Council on Markets in Crypto-assets, and amending Directive (EU) 2019/1937"".

(TL;DR BELOW)

**First of all, some context. This will be a long post but sometimes long posts are necessary. Bear with me.** 

The proposed Regulation, the most important one to date for the entire crypto industry, establishes rules for issuers/offerors of crypto-assets (also known as: the foundations, developers and companies behind coins/tokens) and crypto-asset service providers (also known as: exchanges and custodians).

These rules will have to be followed by every entity operating in the European Union. However, because of the “*Brussels Effect*”, there is a very good chance these rules will become international standards in the end. While everyone is focused on the US and China, the EU is casually leading the way.

The Council of the European Union (all EU Ministers of Finance or Economics) has just given its permission to start negotiations with the European Parliament (basically: things just got real). If they both approve the proposed Regulation, it will become EU law. I expect the Regulation to be voted through relatively easily with only minor amendments. The final legal text to become official EU law will thus be *very similar* to the current proposal I will be discussing in this post.

The European Union emphasizes that they have an interest in “developing and promoting the uptake of transformative technologies in the financial sector, including distributed ledger technology (DLT)”. They state that this Regulation is meant to: “support innovation and fair competition, while ensuring a high level of protection of retail holders and market integrity in crypto-asset markets, enable crypto-asset service providers to scale up their business on a cross-border basis, and facilitate their access to banking services to run their activities smoothly"". The EU also says that they do not (!) intend to regulate the underlying technology of crypto-assets.

I will now discuss (1) the rules this Regulation sets out for issuers/offerors of different categories of crypto-assets and (2) the rules set out for exchanges operating in the European Union.

*Rules in this Regulation for Issuers/Offerors of Crypto-Assets*

**A) Crypto-assets that are unique and not fungible with other crypto-assets: no regulations**

NFTs, including digital art and collectibles are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation, even when these assets are traded in market places and when they have (high) speculative value.

**B)** **Utility Tokens: no regulations**

‘Utility token’ means a type of crypto-asset which is only intended to provide access to a good or a service supplied by the issuer of that token (EU definition). Utility tokens are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation, as long as the good or service exists or is in operation.

**C)** **Crypto-assets offered for free: no regulations**

Crypto-assets where the receiver does not give money, fees, personal data or commissions to the offerors/issuers in return for those crypto-assets, are not (!) bound to bound to the rules described in this Regulation. This may be good news for Moons (there is no active exchange of personal data in return for Moons; even when Reddit collects personal data from all users).

**D) Crypto-assets that are “automatically created as a reward for the maintenance of the DLT or the validation of transactions in the context of a consensus mechanism”: no regulations**

These crypto-assets are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation.

**E) E-Money (stablecoins): very strict regulations**

‘Electronic money token’ or ‘e-money token’ means a type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing to the value of an official currency of a country (EU definition). These tokens will be strictly regulated. Only recognized credit institutions and ‘electronic money institutions’ are allowed to issue e-money stablecoins. They will have to follow very strict rules (see Regulation Title IV for further details). Edit 1: As part of these strict rules, it seems that EU citizens would also not be able to earn interest on stablecoins, as pointed out by u/TheWerewolf5. Edit 2: it will take a while before this is all signed into law so exchanges still have a few years to phase out Tether for regulated stablecoins. There won't be a sudden Tether apocalypse. 

**F) Asset-Referenced Tokens (stablecoins): very strict regulations**

‘Asset-referenced token’ means a type of crypto-asset that is not an electronic money token and that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing to any other value or right or a combination thereof, including one or several official currencies of a country (EU definition). This is what Facebook/Meta tried to do with Libra. These tokens will be strictly regulated. Only recognized credit institutions and entities that have been granted permission by the authority of an EU Member State can issue asset-referenced stablecoins in the European Union. They will have to follow very strict rules (see Regulation Title III for further details).

**G)** **Crypto-assets that do not belong to any of the previously mentioned categories (e.g. payment coins that do not promise a stable value or tokens that cannot be seen as utility tokens): some regulations**

These crypto-assets face some regulation. The Regulation describes very detailed rules on the contents of white papers and also establishes rules on marketing communications. This is bad news for scams with poorly written, undetailed white papers and those using misleading forms of marketing. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will most likely establish templates and standards for white papers in the crypto-industry (see Regulation Title II for further details).

*Rules in this Regulation for Exchanges and Custodians*

**A) Exchanges / custodians (centralized): rather strict regulations**

The Regulation focuses on establishing strict rules, such as: the obligation to apply for official authorization in an EU Member States; the obligation to act in the best interest of clients; the obligation for capital requirements, safeguards and insurance policies; the obligation to follow organizational requirements; the obligation to protect the crypto-assets and funds of clients; the obligation to hold the crypto-assets of clients in separate accounts than the accounts belonging to the exchange; the obligation to maintain effective and transparent complaint handling procedures; the obligation to identify, disclose and prevent conflicts of interest; the obligation to have resilient trading systems with sufficient capacity to deal with peak order and message volumes; and much more (see Regulation Title V for further details).

There is, however, a small but concerning statement for privacy coins: “The operating rules of the trading platform for crypto-assets shall prevent the admission to trading of crypto-assets which have inbuilt anonymisation function unless the holders of the crypto-assets and their transaction history can be identified by the crypto-asset service providers that are authorised for the operation of a trading platform for crypto-assets”. What exactly they mean with this and which coins exactly fall under this category still remains to be seen. But I don't think this comes as a shock for many.

**B) Fully decentralized exchanges and DeFi: no regulations (yet)**

Fully decentralized exchanges and DeFi protocols are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation. Exchanges that are only partially decentralized may be bound to some of the rules in this Regulation but this is up for interpretation. The EU will, in the next few years, explore whether or not they will regulate this specific space.

**C)** **Self-custody software wallets / hardware wallets: no regulations**

These are not (!) bound to the rules described in this Regulation. Remember the huge ""EU will ban anonymous wallets"" FUD a few months ago? It was all a lie. No rules!

*Overall assessment*

I am pleasantly surprised. While some of you want nothing to do with regulation, which I respect, this seems very reasonable and a step in the right direction. This text has clearly been written by highly knowledge civil servants and has been endorsed by EU Ministers of Finance with a more open approach to blockchain and cryptocurrencies than their non-EU counterparts. The EU made the mistake of allowing the US/Asia to dominate the tech industry. They do not want to repeat that mistake with the cryptocurrency space.

**TL;DR: Cryptocurrency will still be the 'Wild West of Finance'; but now there will be a new Sheriff in town. And that Sheriff, is the European Union. It does no longer tolerate unregulated stablecoins; it does no longer tolerate shady projects with no utility, crappy white papers, and misleading marketing; and it sure as hell does no longer tolerate unprofessional exchanges who screw EU citizens out of their money. But it does like innovation and it will try** ***not*** **to hinder development in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space because they have made similar mistakes before in other industries.**

As I was doing my research on alt coins I found market cap to be essential in understanding the relative size and the potential upside of different coins. I found myself constantly doing mental math using CoinMarketCap data, so I decided to build myself a little private website to help with all that! Example: ""_if coin X had market cap of coin Y, it would be worth $Z_"". I figured others are probably in the same position, so I published it yesterday for the world to use. :)

I proudly present to you **[thecoinperspective.com](https://thecoinperspective.com/)**!

**Features:**

- Supports the top 500 non-stable coins/tokens as per CoinMarketCap data. I can add more, if required.
- Quickly see impact of different market caps using a slider, as well as input a hypothetical amount of coins to calculate total worth.
- Supports multiple reference fiat currencies (USD,JPY,GBP,CHF,CAD,AUD,HKD,CNY)
- Coin data is auto-refreshed every 3 hours, including Fiat exchange rates
- Mobile friendly
- No ads, no spam (LPT: use uBlock Origin if you don't already)

I'm still tweaking the UI -- if you have suggestions let me know.

**EDIT**: Thanks for all the feedback!
- Now supports Dark Mode (will default to your OS preference)
- Now supports manual input
- WIP: advanced view, where you can specify all the parameters!


Hope this helps someone. 

p.s. Full disclosure: I piloted this website yesterday in a specific altcoin's subreddit and feedback was very positive and their suggestions helped me drastically improve the website. Now it's a bit more polished and I've worked up the courage to post it in such a big community. Fingers crossed :)",2021-02-16 13:57:30

347,A Coinbase Product Manager was Just Charged With Insider Trading and Arrested While Trying to Flee the Country,7524,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/w4jflp/a_coinbase_product_manager_was_just_charged_with/,1072,"From the Justice Department:

Beginning in approximately October 2020, ISHAN WAHI worked at Coinbase as a product manager assigned to a Coinbase asset listing team. In that role, ISHAN WAHI was involved in the highly confidential process of listing crypto assets on Coinbase’s exchanges and had detailed and advanced knowledge of which crypto assets Coinbase was planning to list and the timing of public announcements about those crypto asset listings.  Beginning at least in August 2021 and continuing through May 2022, ISHAN WAHI was a member of a private Coinbase messaging channel reserved for a small number of Coinbase employees with direct involvement in the Coinbase asset listing process.  The private channel was used to discuss, among other things, “exact announcement / launch dates + timelines” that Coinbase did not wish to share with all of its employees.

***The Insider Trading Scheme:***

On at least 14 occasions beginning at least in June 2021 and continuing through April 2022, ISHAN WAHI knew in advance both that Coinbase planned to list particular crypto assets and the timing of Coinbase’s public announcements of those asset listings and misappropriated that Coinbase confidential information by tipping either his brother, NIKHIL WAHI, or ISHAN WAHI’s friend and associate, SAMEER RAMANI, so that they could place profitable trades in those crypto assets in advance of Coinbase’s public listing announcements.

After getting tips from ISHAN WAHI, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI used anonymous Ethereum blockchain wallets to acquire crypto assets shortly before Coinbase publicly announced that it was listing or considering listing these crypto assets on its exchanges.  Following Coinbase public listing announcements, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI sold the crypto assets for a profit.  Based on confidential information provided by ISHAN WAHI, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI collectively traded shortly in advance of at least 14 separate Coinbase public listing announcements concerning at least 25 different crypto assets.  As a result of the insider trading scheme, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI collectively generated realized and unrealized gains totaling at least approximately $1.5 million.

To conceal their purchases of crypto assets in advance of Coinbase listing announcements, NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI used accounts at centralized exchanges held in the names of others, and transferred funds, crypto assets, and proceeds of their scheme through multiple anonymous Ethereum blockchain wallets.  NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI also regularly created and used new Ethereum blockchain wallets without any prior transaction history in order to further conceal their involvement in the scheme.

***ISHAN WAHI’s Attempt to Flee the United States:***

On April 11, 2022, Coinbase announced that it was considering potentially listing dozens of crypto assets on its exchanges. Based on Coinbase confidential information provided by ISHAN WAHI, RAMANI caused multiple anonymous Ethereum blockchain wallets to purchase large quantities of at least six of the crypto assets that were to be included in Coinbase’s April 11, 2022 listing announcement.

Shortly after RAMANI traded in advance of Coinbase’s April 11 listing announcement, on April 12, 2022, a Twitter account that is well known in the crypto community tweeted regarding an Ethereum blockchain wallet “that bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of tokens exclusively featured in the Coinbase Asset Listing post about 24 hours before it was published.”  The trading activity referenced in the April 12 tweet was the trading caused by RAMANI.  Coinbase thereafter publicly replied on Twitter noting that it had already begun investigating the matter and a few weeks later stated in a public blog post that any Coinbase employee who leaked confidential company information would be “immediately terminated and referred to relevant authorities (potentially for criminal prosecution).”

On May 11, 2022, Coinbase’s director of security operations emailed ISHAN WAHI to inform him that he should appear for an in-person meeting relating to Coinbase’s asset listing process at Coinbase’s Seattle, Washington office on Monday, May 16, 2022. ISHAN WAHI confirmed he would attend the meeting.

On the evening of Sunday, May 15, 2022, ISHAN WAHI purchased a one-way flight to India that was scheduled to depart the next day shortly before ISHAN WAHI was supposed to be interviewed by Coinbase.  Prior to boarding the flight, ISHAN WAHI falsely told Coinbase employees that he had already departed for India when he had not.  In the hours between booking the flight and his scheduled departure, ISHAN WAHI called and texted NIKHIL WAHI and RAMANI about Coinbase’s investigation, and sent both of them a photograph of the messages he had received on May 11, 2022, from Coinbase’s director of security operations.  Prior to boarding the May 16, 2022 flight to India, ISHAN WAHI was stopped by law enforcement and prevented from leaving the country.

I remember at the time thinking there was about a 1/3 chance it would 100x, so there was an asymmetrical risk/reward in my opinion. 

Sold a large chunk during the previous bull run in 2017, and sold the remaining in multiple sales this January. Averaged about a 150x on my cost basis across all sales. All long-term capital gains. Now I'm 27 and financially independent. Will be buying my parents a house this year.

Technical analysis is the study of statistical trends, collected from historical price and volume data, to identify opportunities for trade. Technical analysts observe patterns of price movements, trading signal and other analytical tools to evaluate the strength and weakness of an asset.  

Technical Analysis can be applied to any security with historical trading data such as cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities and stocks.

A chart of prices and volume represents all the past decisions taken by market participants (buying and selling). This information will, in turn, affect future participant decisions in two ways:

* **Psychological**: What you did in the past affects how you approach future situations. For example, many traders tend to focus on the price at which they bought an asset, and if it declines, they want to sell when it reaches break-even again.
* **Reflexive**: Some traders identify trends and chart patterns which are common, and act accordingly (buying or selling). If a sufficient number of participants follow the same strategy, it is expected that these chart patterns will follow the expected outcome and that the trend will likely to be sustained by more and more participants joining the trend.

**Bollinger Bands**

Bollinger Bands display a graphical band (the envelope) with a simple moving average in the middle. The width of the envelope expresses the volatility.

Volatility refers to the rate at which the price of an asset can increase or decrease. A higher volatility means that the asset can potentially **fluctuate rapidly within a larger range of value**.

**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (or MACD) is a trend following indicator that looks at the combination of two moving averages:

* A short-term moving average
* A long-term moving average  


These two moving averages are combined to identify what is the current trend and if there is a change in the momentum.  


The MACD lines displayed below can be interpreted as follows:  


* If the blue line (MACD line) is above the orange line (Signal line), the momentum is bullish.
* On the contrary, if the blue line is below the orange line, the momentum is bearish.
* When the lines diverge, it denotes a strengthening of the current trend while a convergence shows a trend reversal.
* When the lines cross, it is likely that the change in momentum is confirmed.

I endured many nail-biting bear markets, a constant fear of flash crashes, numerous urges to FOMO into different coins, and many other stressful scenarios.

But, at once point during my time investing with crypto, I decided that I need to be patient and smart with me assets: Hold some and stake others for compounded returns. It wasn't a exciting as day trading, but it was a safer route to take. I eventually learned to forget about my portfolio and wait a couple of years until I could check again.

Years later, I am more than happy to say that my crypto portfolio has passed the million dollar mark, making me a crypto millionaire. It was a HUGE accomplishment for me as it will allow me to pursue my interests of playing video games all day and, maybe, start a streaming channel since I always thought of showing off my gaming skills to an audience. It would also give me an opportunity to help out those in need and improve the lives of so many others.

378,I'm Truly Disappointed.,7010,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n3fxk/im_truly_disappointed/,360,"Guys. We need to talk:

This subreddit above all else is supposed to be a hub of news, useful discourse, information, and understanding of cryptocurrencies/crypto assets in general. Through it I've found some amazing coins and made investments that I would have never known to make.

But that's only because I didn't listen to the trash level sentiment being carried out and the hardcore tribalism that causes people to lose out on good, solid investments. So here, lemme break this into 3 categories:

**FOR THE INVESTORS**

It has become incredibly clear to me that FAR too large of a portion of our reader base on this sub is entirely unaware of the fundamentals of investing in new tech. This is not a sports team, this is not some TV show or fad, THIS IS A BRAND FUCKING NEW ASSET CLASS THAT CAN REVOLUTIONIZE OUR SOCIETY. And it is MUCH too early to be acting like we've already made our correct bets and that nothing can happen to change the trajectory of our favorite project.

1) How is the TECH/Whitepaper? (this should always be your FIRST question)

2) How is the Dev Team?

3) Do they have a funding scheme? What kind? (community donation, venture capital, institutional investment/buyouts, ICO etc.)

4) How are they organized?

5) How is their track record?

6) Do they have any institutional or prolific backing?

7) Does it solve a goddamn problem or alleviate friction anywhere?

8) Does it have competition and where does it stand within that?

9) How close to ready is it?

10) Any plans to create, stimulate, and maintain adoption?

11) Does it have a Marketing and media presence? A good one?

12) How is its Mainstream visibility?

13) How about Accesibility and Liquidity?

14) Growth potential based on current price and supply

15) Can it survive or at least get around the regulatory hammer?

Regardless of what you think your coin's shit smells like, these are the things you need to know in order to decide where the hell you're putting your money. Because each and every single one of these questions is important in determining the value potential and sustainability of your coin. If you actually care about making money then you'll shed your need to be on a single team and diversify your assets based on the fundamentals. Yes, I know a month feels like an entire year in crypto, but investment is NORMALLY supposed to be a multi-decade affair. Meanwhile longterm for most of us means 2022 at the latest. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

**FOR THE DAY TRADERS**

In general, you have a very simple job. Look at graphs, do some TA, make a plan, invest based on that and do your best to have orders and trading set up that minimizes risk. So just do that. I don't want to hear a single one of you coming through a subreddit and moaning about how you think something is a shitcoin because it wasn't volatile enough that day to make you dumb amounts of money. No one is saying you aren't making hella money or that you aren't right from a daytrading perspective, but keep that to the trading subreddits where other like-minded people are actually impatient enough to care about that. You should understand that when you put up some pissy comment like that, new investors who haven't the faintest clue on anything will take what you say seriously and model their money movement around your words.

Think about that.

If I had listened to day traders, as a mid-long term investor, I'd have missed out on NEO (back when it was Antshares), ICX, and XRP. I would have missed out on the following percentage gains:

NEO: 1150% Gains as of now
ICX: 5080% Gains as of now
XRP: 1720% Gains as of now

^Why would I want to miss out on that because of impatience and bad philosophy?

**FOR THE SUPPORTERS**

For people who are genuinely in this for philosophy, that's great, discuss the merits of your philosophy and vision and why you think the coin aligns with that. Otherwise:

SHUT THE FUCK UP.

If you don't, you'll start spreading FUD and lies, it's inevitable, the second you decide to trash another coin you're going to do it as a way to feel superior regardless of how good or shitty your investment is.

Through trial and error we all found out small (or big) “lifehacks” that newbies should know from the very start.

Please feel free to share your most useful lifehacks that you found while walking the streets of DeFi.

My top 3 lifehacks are next:

1.  when moving funds across exchanges be smart and use XLM or ALGO for super cheap and super fast transactions. 

2. use bookmarks to avoid getting on a phishing site by accident. Google doesn’t do much about preventing phishing sites to appear in search results, so bookmark them for your safety

3. use whitelisting addresses on exchanges to strengthen your security. Its easy to set it up and effective so that your funds cant go anywhere but to your wallets",2022-01-01 15:42:17

They post the victim and scammer addresses and go on about reaching out to law enforcement blah blah. If you have ever seen a real scammers account, there are usually tons of transactions and money being moved quick to avoid being black listed by exchanges.  The past few post ive seen, the 'hackers' account has only 1 transaction. Seems strange doesn't it?   
Let's also take OP's Reddit age into account .   
  
Now, not all post are scams but unfortunately, it only takes a few bad apples to spoil the bunch.  With it being the holidays, people probably feel a bit more generous and want to help out someone in need.",2021-12-25 04:26:26

***Find the full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the FOUR YEAR REPORT for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,** and **Stellar.**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting every single month for four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and more recently, the [2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/). ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.
* **December** **Highlights:** A bloody, all-red month
* **Overall since Jan. 2018:** **ETH** solidly in the lead, followed by **BTC** and **ADA.**  After briefly pulling ahead earlier in the year, ***the 2018 Top Ten are now significantly underperforming the S&P 500*** over the same time period.  Q: So, big crypto fail, right?
* A: Only if I stopped after the first year.  The **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 406%, much, much better than traditional markets over the same time period (**fancy new chart at the very bottom of the post).

***Some exciting new changes for*** [2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!***

1. I'll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis (down to two reports per month)
2. Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time. 
3. Factoring in stablecoin gains:  In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).
4. Giveaways: Who doesn’t love a good old fashioned giveaway? I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.
5. Friendly competition: I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP r/TotalCryptoMarketCap) to see which one outperforms.

And here we go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Four Year Report – UP 34%

https://preview.redd.it/c3c6wlctpgb81.jpg?width=1056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4a139e422647297b558b778711c2ca3d1b01a488

Welcome to the four year report!

The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,** and **Stellar**.  

December highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **100% red month**. **IOTA** falls the least, only down -4% (on news that staking on the Firefly wallet will yield two cryptos, Assembly and Shimmer).
* **ETH** maintains a solid overall lead, **BTC** in second place, **ADA** in third.  Three coins in the green since January 2018.
* After four years, the 2018 Portfolio is +34%, behind the S&P 500’s ROI over the same time period.

## December Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranks since January 2018:

https://preview.redd.it/ulc9dwgvpgb81.jpg?width=412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=51b9f8a5acf84232fa4b6f997cf200214a839a94

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:** After four years of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have remained.  **NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA**, and **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Tether**, **DOT, SOL**, **LUNA**, and **USDC.  NEM** looks like it wants to be the first to drop out of the Top 100.

## December Winners and Losers

***December Winners*** –  **IOTA** outperformed the pack, dropping only -4% this month. 100% of the cryptos in the red.

***December Losers*** –   Losing nearly a third of its value, **Litecoin** fell the most, down -30%. **NEM** followed **LTC**, dropping -27% in December.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After four years, here’s a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. 

https://preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=60cdac19d82f219da3525ab7778266cc5ea3f983

With 11, **Bitcoin** has two more monthly wins than second place **Cardano**.  **NEM** has finished last place most often (12 months out of 48).

**Bitcoin** is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).

## Overall Update –  2021 ends with a whimper. After four years, ETH in first place, and Dash and NEM tied for worst overall performance.

After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in [October](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio continued to lose value.  After four years of holding these cryptos, only 3 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: **BTC,** **ETH,** and **ADA.**

Overall, first place **ETH** (+413%) is well ahead of **BTC** (+257%) and third place **ADA** (+99%).

The initial $100 invested in first place **ETH** four years ago?  It’s worth $515 today.

**DASH** and **NEM** are virtually tied at the bottom, both down over -86% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.**  The initial $100 invested in each four ago is worth about $13 today.  

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/mldnsr7zpgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3cc38383ed29a0a2ec36b9d69ec4388be2b4cfe6

End of December 2021 market cap: **$2,211,626,655,207**

The total crypto market dropped significantly in December.  Crypto as a sector is still up +285% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+34%), the return of the S&P (+78%) over the same period of time, and nine of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for **Ethereum)**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.65T in** [**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/)**.**

## Bitcoin dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/qygnx0a0qgb81.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2727a5f71a265d7ab6a9454a59c0e6b1f5bb8705

**BitDom** declined a bit in December, ending the month at 40.2%.  When looking at the entire four year 2018 Experiment time frame, **BTC** dominance is near the low end.  For context:   

Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**33% in January 2018**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one).

High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: 

https://preview.redd.it/cxtd9lb1qgb81.jpg?width=339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=493ac038d25dfe29b3d5f12f1e40bd334ed0e817

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost $325 in December.

If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, **the $1000 initial investment would be worth $1,341**, up 34% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

Green is unfamiliar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and a recent development.  Over the first four years of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only ten months of green.  And all ten of the green months have come in 2021. 

Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment four years ago:

https://preview.redd.it/cbumx113qgb81.jpg?width=654&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6dc9fda3731f8858169279de114cec2be212bc7d

The all time high for this portfolio is [October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46) (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).   

Remember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 in the ***2019***, ***2020,*** and ***2021*** Top Ten Cryptos as well (***(and, just announced,*** [***again in 2022***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!)***.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48): up +34% (total value $1,341)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36) up +504% (total value $6,044)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24): up +795% (total value $8,951)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +292% (total value $3,921)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,257** ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).

**That’s up +406%** on the combined portfolios, **down from** [**last month’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47) for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/xcl80o35qgb81.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5d6ddc6d0b5fa7790a55493f890b3ec6c9190812

***That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four years in a row.***

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  

https://preview.redd.it/3uss07c8qgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70e72c223a768b7842f0b5a82baa74371d6fd9b9

After four years: the S&P 500 is up +78% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would be worth $1,780 had it been redirected to the S&P.  That’s more than double the +34% return of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio over the same period of time.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P:

We need to contact the EU/Italian authorities & make sure he's punished.",6947,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7wlo19/the_bitgrail_hack_was_months_ago_bomber_defrauded/,877,"Let's be clear here Francesco Firano (/u/TheBomber9) is a criminal. The hack was in November which means that he's been insolvent for months & has been defrauding new users out of their money to keep the exchange afloat. Once the Binance listing was imminent he locked all the exchange's assets. His actions show clear intent. If his exchange was hacked & he immediately reported it to the police, he'd just be incompetent but by hiding this from new users he transitioned from moron to criminal. 

This is the US legal definition of Fraud:

* Fraud. A false representation of a matter of fact—whether by words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, **or by concealment of what should have been disclosed**—that deceives and is intended to deceive another so that the individual will act upon it to her or his legal injury.

[In order to be convicted of fraud in the US, the following must be proved:](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fraud)

>Fraud must be proved by showing that the defendant's actions involved five separate elements: 

> * (1) a false statement of a material fact,

>* (2) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue, 

>* (3) intent on the part of the defendant to deceive the alleged victim, 

>* (4) justifiable reliance by the alleged victim on the statement, and 

>* (5) injury to the alleged victim as a result.

Now I'm not a lawyer but it seems to me that he is clearly guilty & convictable. It's likely the EU/Italian definition is the same since fraud is a universal crime. [He may also be guilty of running a ponzi scheme](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ponzi_scheme)

We need to make sure people don't get away with this sort of thing. I don't want to say he's destroyed people's lives because there is almost always a way to recover but he has certainly severely damaged peoples wellbeing. 

I'm in the US but if someone in the EU/Italy could contact the authorities & let them know about the situation maybe we can get a little bit of justice for his victims. I don't trust him at all when he said he has reported this to authorities, it's **very likely he completely misrepresented the situation to them** even if he did (which is also a crime).

If you live in the USA & are a victim please call the FBI to file a report. Apparently extradition is possible between the USA & Italy. If there is enough outcry about this situation maybe we can get the wheels turning.

Edit: [He's also guilty of embezzlement](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/embezzlement )

> Elements common to embezzlement are as follows: (1) the property must belong to a person other than the accused, such as an employer or principal; (2) the property must be converted subsequent to the defendant's original and lawful possession of it; (3) the defendant must be in a position of trust, so that the property is held by him or her pursuant to some fiduciary duty; and (4) the defendant must have an intent to defraud the owner at the time of the conversion.

Edit: Evidence he knew about the hack (personally I think it's borderline impossible for him not to realize he's missing over 3/4ths of the XRB in his wallet but here's some hard evidence anyways).

Bitcoin Cash doesn't have such a problematic origin, but might also be considered an unwise purchase given the lack of usage and development compared to BTC and other good projects.

So, when I open the charts and see that specifically BCH and ETC have been pumping hard for the last couple of days, my only conclusion is that new retail investment money has arrived and these noobs are dropping cash on 'cheaper' projects with the name Bitcoin and Ethereum in it. I should know, I did this exact thing myself earlier this year!

Here's hoping this signals the start of a another massive pump too.

That is just impossible, unless somehow they have developed ways to crack SHA256 and brute force wallet private keys. In which case, BTC is the least of everyone's worries and state/nuclear secrets could be under risk. 

[While Bitcoin isn’t stored on a server, the private keys to unlock the Bitcoin may have been.

What rubbish, if FBI can empty anyone's wallet they can get BTC from the top addresses and all become billionaires themselves. This is some of the weakest FUD but people still seem to be falling for this.


Edit: Lots of comments seem to suggest that governments are developing or have developed ""quantum computers"" that can crack/hack bitcoin private keys. While quantum computers can definitely become a threat to cryptocurrencies in the future, they are not presently anywhere close to being capable of deriving the private key for a bitcoin address. 

As per u/BreakingBaIIs : 

> I did a back-of-envelope calculation that showed that it would be faster to mine all the remaining bitcoins 6 billion times than it would to crack a single private key using brute force.

> If the FBI found a way to efficiently crack a private key, that would mean they solved the most important math problem humanity has ever faced, that P=NP (in the affirmative). What they could do would go far beyond breaking all of the Internet's security protocols (which they could do). They would be able to solve all the mathematical theorems that humanity has ever worked on for thousands of years, plus many new ones we never thought about, in a matter of days or hours. They would be able to efficiently create superhuman AI using modest computational resources.

The complexity of cracking a single BTC private key is large and currently not in existence. 

Moreover, if such a powerful computer existed, it would be a threat to several other things rather than bitcoin and crypto. The entire internet runs on cryptographic encryption. Nothing would be safe. In fact, someone in possession of much less powerful quantum computing power can easily hack into Federal reserve and transfer out every dollar there, or hack into Bank of England and shut everything down. In other words, cryptocurrencies would not even be among the top threats, because much bigger and important threats would be easily taken over. 

If they had quantum computers, they wont be asking Apple to de-encrypt devices seized from criminals. 

If they have quantum computers that can reverse engineer the private keys to any BTC address, they wont bother recovering measly 60 BTC from the 80 BTC ransom, when they can just send BTC to zero by hacking and moving Satoshi coins, thus destroying BTC's narrative completely. 

Tl:dr - Its preposterous to suggest anything like this exists. While it is true that research and development on quantum computers is an ongoing topic, there is no evidence to suggest that such a quantum computing system exists today that can derive BTC private keys from just the addresses.",2021-06-08 12:46:41

395,"Real, mainstream crypto adoption is happening right now. You just haven't realized.",6849,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nobj1h/real_mainstream_crypto_adoption_is_happening/,831,"Yes, that's quite the title, I know. But after seeing the hundredth post on the frontpage talking about altcoins that have real use cases, I can't stop thinking about this one.

You all know Venezuela, right? The country with space-high inflation rates, the one that /r/cryptocurrency says crypto adoption is feasible. 

Well, it's finally really happening.

I'm Venezuelan, so let me explain some weird things about our economy. First, prices double every 3 months. Second, we don't have access to USD bank accounts in the country. And third, physical cash is scarce: Bolivares because you need a lot of them to pay for little, and USD because the ""dollarization"" isn't official, small change simply doesn't exist (coins, for example). This creates the perfect variables for digital, exact payment. This is where the Reserve Protocol comes in.

We have been using some digital payments app since a while ago, apps like Zelle, PayPal or Transferwise. The problem with those apps is that they often close accounts in Venezuela to avoid problems with the US government. Simply put, those companies just didn't want to deal with the problem that is Venezuela related legislation.

Enter [Reserve.](https://reserve.org/) The team at Reserve created a stablecoin alongside an easy to use app for mainstream use. The app allows people to deposit Bolivares (the local currency) from their bank account and instantly exchange them for dollars (RSV stablecoins!). You might be thinking, well, that isn't that big of a deal, is it? Thing is, it is. Venezuelans can't just exchange Bolívares to USD legally because there aren't any bank accounts in USD inside Venezuela. The only way to save in USD would be to open an account in Panamá or risk your money getting lost in Zelle or PayPal. The app allows people to send RSV, pay with RSV, receive any crypto and convert it to RSV or Bolivares and so on. Reserve is literally saving people from hyperinflation.

Well, why do I say mainstream crypto adoption is happening? Because people aren't paying in bolivares anymore. It is estimated that in 2020, 55% of transactions were made in foreign currency, and that number just keeps growing everyday. Now, the great part.

**The Reserve app has more than 100k downloads.** **People are using** **crypto, not as a way to invest, not as a store of value, but as it was intended: a currency.**  And it's happening right in front of us, but we're too worried about the price going up or down so much that we missed the real reason crypto is here: to serve as a currency when fiat fails us. In my case, fiat failed me. And crypto, for me and many more, is the way.",2021-05-30 13:45:45

We all know that memecoins like DOGE have pumped and made many people rich. That's why people invest in memecoins, because it's a potential goldmine if you get in early with the right one. However, once a memecoin pumps, how will they attract new investors if they think the main pump has already happened? 

This has already happened with SHIB. Why did so many people invest in SHIB? Because they saw what happened with DOGE and bought into what they believed was ""the next DOGE"", a new memecoin with a growing community that they thought could ""do what DOGE did"". And they were right! The early investors have made a lot of money with SHIB. However, after the BIG pump is over, do new investors want the coin that has already had the big pumps, or the newest memecoin that has the potential to do what that memecoin did? 

Memes die, and so do memecoins. How often do you see Ugandan Knuckles memes anymore? The kind of people who invest in memecoins are  trying to find ""the next DOGE"" or ""the next SHIB"", not DOGE or SHIB. So once new investors believe that the project has already had its big pump, they move on to the next one.

Because that's the trick.  The trick to a 401K is to get everyone to hold because if everyone sells, then everyone else who didn't sell fast enough will lose money and the whole thing will crash.    That's why they charge penalities.    

It's like investing in safemoon and they charge you penalities for selling In order to keep the current value more stable so the entirety of holders don't start panic selling it into oblivion.

Also you can panic sell a 401K too.  It happened to many people after the housing market crash of 2008.    My mom panic sold her 401k because it went from $50K to $9K ...I didn't know much about investing back then, but I will never forget what she said.  *I was afraid I would lose it all, it kept going down* 

What she said sounds much like what people say about Bitcoin today. 

Nowadays my mom is retired, and sometimes she brings that up...*I should've just kept it in...it went back up*

Unfortunately this is how the most powerful people work.  They shake out weak hands so they can buy up super low.   Otherwise there would be no big guy buying your shit back.  

Rich are buying your shit cheap for a reason...not just because they are just speculating. 


So yeah, you can get serious FUD with 401K and it's not just coming from my mom. Many honest hard working people don't understand the game whales play...they get shilled into things and are convinced it's safe because their employer offers it.    All a 401K is, is investments into stocks and bonds that are stable but not always safe. 

So if you can continually dump every paycheck into something that penalizes you for withdrawing early and hold that shit for 30 years , then you can buy Bitcoin  once and hold it for 3 years without any penality for withdrawing some too early unless tax on capital gains. But that's normal. 

So stick to your original plan, and hold.",2021-05-29 17:22:38

I say this so when people try to make the drug argument, it's important to remember not all drugs are illegal, and for some people, using Monero and darknet markets are their only option to survive.

411,"If you are a student, focus on your studies.",6678,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n328cf/if_you_are_a_student_focus_on_your_studies/,771,"I am 30+ yo now. I used to be a student 10 years ago. Now I have a decent job. 
I can't help but think in which mindset are students who lately made some quick gains. If you did take some gains, I can only congratulate you, you probably did better than most of your student peers who are probably not fully aware of what crypto is.

But be aware that once you make your first gains, there is something I call the ""casino effect"". It pushes you to take more and more risks. I think it can be even amplified as a student because most of you don't have yet a monthly income. I remember that each penny counts and insane gains can start turning your head. At the same time, you are in the period of your life when you need to make very important decisions.

Lately, you might read about young Samsung employees quitting their jobs in South Korea thanks to millions of $ they earned in crypto. Or read cool posts about huge gains and lambo.
And you might think there is no good reason to study anymore.
Strangely there is not much about people ashamed of massive losses.

My message is for you to keep in mind you must measure your risk. Crypto is great but who knows when the rollercoaster ends or when you will make bad moves (we all do). You can not rely only on that. Hopefully the recent dip made you realize that. Please treat your study as your top priority and crypto as a bonus. If you make it in crypto, that would be amazing. If not, you still have a diploma and a good option in life.

- Crypto = great
- Crypto + job = better

Don't gamble on your life. Don't have regrets. Decision is only yours.

Your crypto older brother who wish you good in life.",2021-05-02 08:35:52

Whether you're throwing your money at the latest meme coin or you've spent a lot of time DYOR on some promising project, it's a good time to remind people that 90+% of these projects simply will not make it.

Maybe they die completely, or maybe they just linger at the fringe like some projects have, just crabbing sideways (or downward) for years.

So a good idea is to, whenever your favorite crypto doubles, take out your initial investment. Yes, it could keep going up and you'd miss out on those gains, but it could also go down and you'd lose everything. 

Once you've taken back your initial investment though, you are playing with free money. You'd be surprised just how relaxing it is to check the charts on a ""free money"" crypto and not really care if the latest candle is red or green.

A good strategy is to continue doing the same thing every time that coin doubles. Take out half, leave the other half invested. Rinse and repeat. It's a super easy way to always know when you should be taking profits along the way, and also a way to always have dry powder to buy into any available price dips.",2021-11-08 22:16:54

Of course I am speaking of popular and trustworthy exchanges. Leaving your crypto on an exchange nobody has ever heard of is of course a dumb idea.

But do you want to tell me that your crypto is not safe on Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Crypto.com or Voyager? It is 2021 and not 2014 and these exchanges can not be compared to Mt Gox.

Also sometimes people get the whole ""not your keys, not your crypto"" thing too seriously. I have seen people here complainig that they lost a big amount of their ETH to move it to a cold wallet. Well, high gas fees are another topic but you definitely shouldn't move your crypto to a wallet if you have to lose like 1/4 of it to do that. If you just have 0.05 ETH or similar then just leave it on the exchange. Nothing will happen to it.

Not to mention that if you are new in crypto then it is more likely for you to lose your piece of paper with your seed phrase than an exchange like Kraken or Coinbase to get hacked. If you ever accumulate a bigger amount of crypto then you could think about buying a cold wallet!

I have added all that information into an infographic, as well as adding new coins, new categories and making some changes based on your feedback.

I hope you find it useful.

Edit: Due to popular demand I have added Moons (MOON)

**Edit 3: Version 2.0 is below. Thanks for everyone's feedback.**

Changes:

1. Certain coins are easier to see
2. Some categories moved for less confusion, e.g. privacy coins are now under currency along with stablecoins.
3. Icons have been added for ERC20, BEP2/BEP20, and Forks
4. Some descriptions changed slightly for accuracies
5. Some typos fixed (e.g. USDC instead of CSDC)
6. Stellar moved out of the distributed computing category as it doens't offer an on-chain programming language or on-chain smart contracts, it now bridges the currency and finance categories.

&#x200B;

Edit2: Thanks for all the fantastic feedback and awards. I'm working on a version 2 which will address some of the issues people have had.

1. Certain coins hard to find/unclear
2. I didn't intend for privacy coins to look like it was a subset of store of value, however it looks like people are interpreting it that way. I am going to move it under currency and change a few things round so similar categories are grouped together.
3. Thinking of adding icons next to coins indicating additional properties of that coin, e.g. ERC20 token, BSC20 token, Fork of bitcoin
4. Description of DeFi section is off, because some of the projects are centralised, so am changing it to just 'financial services'
5. Various small typos/capital letter inconsistencies.
6. Changing Stellar/XLM to just currency, and possibly make it part of the DeFi group, as the smart contracts are not executed on chain, and so it can't really be considered distributed computing.

Also another reason why taking profits is a good idea! If you don’t have fiat available. Maybe take profits next time so you’ll have spending money on the next dip. 

Anyone else get any good deals or catch the drop? Good luck everyone!

""Hodl"" is a stupid meme for newbs. I learned the hard way.

So called ""fundamentals"" ('solid team', 'awesome project', 'upcoming partnerships')  don't reflect the price in a company that received its funding before it has ever proven anything (that's the primary difference between an ICO and an IPO). ***Where my REQ marines at?***

When this bull run is actually over (and personally i don't believe that it is yet), you probably won't come to accept it until your portfolio is sitting at 50% of its ATH and your ""stack"" of crypto has become a ""bag"" you're stuck holding ""until you reach XX number again--then you'll sell *for sure*.""

Here's the reality: Once the bubble pops, every crash is going to seem like a ""dip"" and every ""bounce"" is going feel like a ""this is gentlemen.""  ***That's how frogs get boiled to death.***

Here are some principles you need to keep in mind if you want to walk away from this bull run with a fat stack of cash:

1. Recognize and accept that you won't sell the exact top, and that--subsequently--your portfolio's ""true value"" is only what you sell it for--not what it's ATH was at one point.
2. Pick a realistic sum (take your dream figure and subtract 50%) at which you're going to cash out a certain percentage--or all of it--and (here's the important part): ***STICK TO IT.***
   1. This latter point is most crucial, because as the sum grows and actually hits that number you picked, you're going to be very tempted to leave it in ""just a little longer"". That's greed talking. If you ask Greed ""how much is enough?"" the answer is always ""a little bit more."" Have discipline in this and you'll win. Let greed take over and you'll lose. *If you let greed govern your decisions in a bull market, then you'll let panic govern your decisions in a bear market.*
3. You can't predict the future--so don't judge your past self for knowledge you have today. ""Why didn't i buy that coin?!?! it just mooned!"" Or ""Why didn't i sell before it crashed?!"" You know what happened yesterday because it's today--you can't get mad at yourself for not possessing today's knowledge on the day before yesterday.
4. My final and **MOST IMPORTANT** point:
   1. As I said before ***your portfolio is only worth what you actually sell it for***. So do **NOT** focus on ***how much it was*** or ***how much it could have been*** \-- if you make this mistake you will be dissatisfied at turning $1000 into $100,000. If you've only got a $1,000 right now, you're probably thinking ""of course i'd be happy with $100k!"" -- but when you get there you'll be holding out for 200/300/1 million. In your greed, you won't be satisfied with an enormous return--especially if you keep thinking about how you could have had $1,000,000 if you just ""bought that dip"" that no one saw coming or ""held xyz coin"" a little bit longer.  ***Focus on what you have today--not what you might have tomorrow.***

Crypto transactions connected to crime have hit an all time low last year, just 0,34% of all transactions are somehow connected to ""crime"" (this includes your local guy ordering weed)



What about the U.S. Dollar and other FIAT?

The United Nations estimates that up to $4,000,000,000,000 annualy is connected to crime, which is up to 4% of global GDP.



Why is no politician talking about that?

462,The ultimate guide to earning passive income with cryptocurrencies 📌,6294,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lk2rtw/the_ultimate_guide_to_earning_passive_income_with/,1356,"Most of us are here to make money. Some people try trading, while others just HODL and check the prices every 5 minutes. And even though many of us have made decent amounts, neither of these two ways can guarantee a reliable source of income.

But what if I told you that apart from trading and holding, there are other ways that can make you money in the crypto space? Well, in this guide I have collected most of these methods so that you can pick out the ones you prefer, and start earning passive income with crypto.

# #1 - Staking

Staking is an activity where a user locks or holds his funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to participate in maintaining the operations of a proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain system. It is similar to crypto mining in the sense that it helps a network achieve consensus while rewarding users who participate.

Staking can be an excellent way to increase your cryptocurrency holdings with minimal effort. You can stake various cryptocurrencies such as DOT, ADA, AVAX etc. By doing this, you earn a certain APY (annual percentage yield), usually between 4%-25% depending on how long you are willing to lock your cryptos.

You can either stake a coin from a wallet such as Exodus, or you can stake your coins on a few exchanges (e.g. Binance). As always, DYOR before locking your crypto for 30-60-90 or more days.

# #2 - Airdrops

An airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. Small amounts of the new virtual currency are sent to the wallets of active members of the blockchain community for free or in return for a small service, such as retweeting a post sent by the company issuing the currency.

The famous Uniswap airdrop made 49 million UNI claimable for users whose address has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. Each address could claim 400 UNI (worth ≈ $7400), which is a nice sum for doing almost nothing.

It is worth keeping an eye out for possible future airdrops, so make sure to follow the news! :)

# #3 - Reddit Moons

Most of the users here already know, but for those who don't (and with a large influx of new members, it's possibly a lot of you guys), you can earn Moons for upvotes on this subreddit. But what are Moons?

""Moons exist as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, where they are managed by a suite of smart contracts that handle balances, transfers, distribution/claiming, and purchasing Special Memberships. The smart contracts and mobile apps have been reviewed and audited by Trail of Bits, an independent security firm with blockchain expertise.

As blockchain tokens, Moons are independent of Reddit. Once you’ve earned them, neither Reddit nor moderators can take your Moons away or decide what you do with them. They’re all yours.""

In order to be able to claim your Moons, you'll need to download the Reddit mobile app and set up your vault (click on your icon at the top left of the home page).

The main purpose for moons is to own a share of the community (vote on governance/distribution proposals) as well as redeem them for the premium membership, which allows you to change the color of your username, embed gifs in comments, add custom flair, etc.

To sum it up, you earn Moons by commenting and posting - something that you'd normally do anyway. Just don't forget to create your vault!

In case you want to, you have the option to sell your Moons. The current price of Moons is $0.071380 / coin (15/02/2021), and you can only sell your moons on Honeyswap at the moment.

# #4 - Nexo, Celsius, etc.

This method is very similar to what banks offer on your investment, except that on Nexo and Celsius you can earn up to 6-14% just by keeping your crypto, stablecoin or fiat on their site.

While the saying ""not your keys, not your coins"" is true, these companies are insured and have never been hacked before. As far as I know, both of these sites have a daily payout system, and you can deposit and withdraw funds whenever you want to.

If you choose this method, it might be worth splitting your investment between these sites in order to prepare for the worst and also to be able to claim offers and bonuses on both sites once available.

# #5 - Coinbase Earn

Not a ""passive"" method, but I felt like I should add this one to the list. Many of you are already familiar with the ""It ain't much, but it's honest work"" meme referring to Coinbase Earn, a program where you can earn a few coins by watching educational videos of certain cryptocurrencies and solving the quizzes that follow said videos.

In my country, currently Graph, Compound, XLM, CELO, Band, and Maker are available through Coinbase Earn, and if you complete all of these crypto's quizzes, you can earn up to $30-$40. In crypto, of course.

Compared to the previous methods, it truly ain't much, but it's honest work, and who knows how these coins will perform in the upcoming years. Worth a shot!

The customer service told him also that anyone who tries to send money to any crypto exchange will be reported (to whom? Lol) and their account will be terminated.

481,Investing in Crypto with Low Income: How I've been doing it,6170,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m983wv/investing_in_crypto_with_low_income_how_ive_been/,677,"I'm from a 3rd world country with a very unstable economy and hyper inflated currency. I got into cryptocurrency at the beginning of COVID because I lost my job and there were no other jobs available, so I did some research and saw how fiat and will of governments are the major reason my people suffer this much and also how crypto can help bypass these restrictions.

So, after doing research and calculating electricity costs and gains, I invested most of my savings into a small mining rig which ended up earning me more money per month than my previous job because the price of ETH got better. For reference I was making 110$ per month from my job, but I was earning roughly 160$ from mining every month. I found another job recently, but for quite some time, mining was my primary source of income. Now I roughly earn 300$ per month, mining + my job.

Anyway the reason I brought this up was to show how little I was earning and how I still managed to invest in crypto. Usually investing requires a large amount of initial capital (Such as stocks and property), which many people don't have, but crypto doesn't have any such barrier. I started spending less and less on things I didn't really need. Smoking, drinking, occasional drug use (marijuana) and ordering food all the time. These can be anything, for me it was these things. Some people spend excessive money on collectible, games, clothing etc... So its up to each individual to find out what is their needless spending.

I quit smoking, drugs and alcohol and started cooking more. This allowed me to invest around 1$ per day in BTC or coin of my choice. Sometimes I simply held onto my ETH instead of selling it, and sometimes I bought another coin. But as I said, it was around 30$ a month. It's basically nothing in terms of international value, but it was decent amount of money for me (inflation is a bitch) and now depending on the coin I invested in, I have profits in almost all of them. Even though I convert most of my mining into fiat to spend on bills and costs of living, every investment I made I've been hodling ever since. It didn't make me rich or anything, but now I have basically tripled my investments and have more in savings than I ever did.

Which one are you more likely to regret more:

1. I could have spent the whole year smoking and drinking, and eating bad food, but I didn't
2. I could have spent the whole year investing in crypto and living a healthier life, but I didn't

In fact, with my savings, I would feel less terrible for indulging in things I quit now and then, because its no longer a big economic drain like it used to be and we are all human, so we do deserve some leisure spending. Its all thanks to that crucial year of investing.

I recommend everyone to do their own research, but I still believe it's early enough to invest a small amount of your income in crypto every month, hodl and see profits long term. My mother thinks I am some kind of genius for tripling our savings, but she simply doesn't understand the concept of crypto. In reality, I was just following crypto info on my 2nd monitor while gaming and not spending money on things I didn't need. I am no genius. Crypto simply provides investment opportunities to people who don't have large initial capital to invest in traditional investment avenues.

I hope this has been helpful to other people with low income, specially others who are also from countries that have unstable economy and inflated currencies. Even 1%-5% of your monthly income in crypto is a good long term investment, but as always do your own research and pick your coins. I didn't do ""day trading"" or try to invest in new coins, hoping they would go up. I mainly invested in coins that were solid already. I would suggest the same for fellow low income investors. In the end this has been my experience, and I thought I should share it. And don't forget, this is just for one year. The more we hold, the better. Finally, even if we don't make it, we have merely sacrificed unnecessary things in our lives, we still have the friends and connections we made along the way.

P.S: Happy new year and Nowruz to everyone who follow Iranian/Zoroastrian solar calendar around the world! The equinox is upon us and spring has sprung! Happy first day of spring.

Edit: Thanks a lot for all the rewards and support! I would love to message each one of you to thank you individually, but there is so many of you! Thank you very much for all the support.",2021-03-20 14:28:00

Essentially Coin Bureau is paid to shill the highest bidder. They want you buying their shitty hoodies and t-shirts while they cram misinformation and their agenda down your throat. 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: Do not trust coin bureau. Guy is a paid actor who has zero technical knowledge. Coin Bureau is owned BY V3 digital, a marketing firm out of London that shills for the highest bidder. It is an untrustworthy source of information. Know you're being manipulated. Their ""mistakes"" are not mistakes at all. Rather highly focused and targeted marketing with the intent to manipulate your crypto decisions.**

493,Save yourself trouble and just stay quiet about investing in crypto,6118,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pqidia/save_yourself_trouble_and_just_stay_quiet_about/,1512,"  

My only friend in the whole wide world just got into crypto because I told him that I made a small profit since I started. My pal went ahead and started watching bitboy-like youtubers and lost a whole lotta money. Now he is trying to blame it on me for telling him to get into crypto. 

I wholeheartedly believe that telling your friends or family about investing in crypto is just asking for trouble. Money can be evil and can destroy many things, also long-time friendships and even family. I’ve seen it before with some of my relatives and you don’t want that.

And family dinners will be far less enjoyable when crypto will dip and they will start lecturing you with “I knew that computer money is a hoax”. They don’t understand crypto. They don’t even remotely understand what it’s trying to achieve.

Keep your investments to yourself. There is no need to announce it to everyone. You don’t go around telling people how thick your wallet is right? You should stay safe. Be a Satoshi, an unknown figure from the darkness of the web. Banks and government know about you too much already, no need to give them any additional information.

Remove network of accounts from receiving Moons this distribution for subreddit manipulation amounting to 138,733 moons.",6107,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pjxnut/emergency_proposal_less_than_24_hours_to_vote/,1510,"###[New daily here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pjz7g6/daily\_discussion\_september\_8\_2021\_gmt0/)


------------

###IOS VOTING IS HAPPILY BUGGED, USE A LAPTOP/DESKTOP.

It has recently come to our attention that a user has been operating several accounts for the sole purpose of bypassing the karma limits imposed by Governance polls to earn more moons than possible each distribution.

&#x200B;

For obvious reasons, we can't divulge too many details on how this has been identified, though Reddit admins have actioned some of the accounts listed (which usually happens when the accounts repeatedly upvote themselves) but you should know that this has been passed around the moderation team and there exists no shadow of doubt that these are the same entity. The user has since confirmed as much in a message to the moderation team. You may know this user as:

u/Hame_BiH  
u/TDavid13  
u/DestroRe13  
u/mahatmadandi  
u/Obito_DOS3  

&#x200B;

**Over the course of the previous distributions, this user has been given a total of 138,733 moons - which should have been spread fairly around the community of users here that earns them.**

&#x200B;

While this user and all accounts have been permanently banned, the timing of the bans means that the 5,655 moons marked for distribution will still be paid out on the 8th September unless a poll passes.

&#x200B;

We have very strict rules on using multiple accounts to bypass the karma cap, or otherwise game the system in an effort to earn more moons.  Rule 3 is ""No Manipulation"" and that counts for bypassing Governance rules for the subreddit.

**It is not fair for the rest of the users who are following the rules to have these moons distributed for ill-gotten karma, especially not over several accounts.**

Unfortunately, the rest of the moons these accounts have received cannot be recovered (the beauty of trustless, blockchain technology) but we can at least act now to prevent this final distribution from rewarding this user for their bad-faith posting. If this karma is removed from the distribution, the current ratio will increase, giving each and every user more moons for their karma this round  This will be a record-setting poll if it passes, and it is a long shot.

&#x200B;

By this poll passing, it will remove the above accounts from the current distribution, ensuring they do not receive the final moons allocated for their posts in snapshot 17. The methodology to address problem users has been laid out by Reddit admins.

An additional effect of the poll passing will be less karma in the pool, meaning the Karma:Moons ratio goes up - more moons for everyone!

Its renouned worldwide . Bottles  of wine start at $500. All that to say that the food should be amazing.  Only for you to be served chicken tendies and soggy fries from the kids  menu.

You look around then down at your plate. ""I thought this was supposed to be good?"" You think to yourself.

Here comes your buddy, the guy who invited you to the restaurant. (Put in his entire life savings in at $0.35)

""Told you this place is the shit bro."" Your buddy says as he sits down and is served a TV dinner from Banquet.

""Oh  yeah the food isn't great... right now. But wait until later trust me  bro."" He says as he starts to unwrap the plastic film with a big grin on  his face.

Just as you were about  to take a bite of your tendie Allincrypto sits down at your table. ""Sup  boys, Allincrypto here."" Then immediately takes a bite of a turd Charles  Hoskinsin layed on his plate.

""Oh my favorite!"" He says as he leans forward and eats the log apple bobbing style with no hands.

""Don't think about your food now. Think about the filet mignon of tomorrow."" As he goes in for another bite.

Disgusted,  you look out the window at a run down diner across the street. You peer  into the window and see families laughing and having a good time. You  see the waitress walk over to the table with what looks like a bacon  cheeseburger and a new york strip steak.

""Wow that looks pretty good."" You mutter to yourself.

Just as you say that Allincrypto and your buddy surround you.

""That place is so shit."" They say in unison as they both proceed to shut the curtains from each side.

Right before the curtains fully close you look up at the neon sign above the diner. It reads ""Ethereum diner""

You turn around and stand up. Everyone in the restaurant has stopped eating and is glaring at you in complete silence.

""Hail Hydra"" they start chanting.

They all get up and start to surround you while still chanting ""Hail Hydra""

A woman shouts from the back, ""Hydra will save us! Kill the non believer!""

""Im  sorry! I will eat my tendie please don't hurt me! That place across the  street sucks."" But it doesn't work and they proceed towards you slowly.  You shut your eyes and prepare for the worst.

You suddenly wake up in your bed.

""Omg it was a dream. Thank god."" You think to yourself.

You pull out your phone to look at your portfolio.

$10,000 bought at $2.68. Portfolio down 69.420%

You  walk over to the bathroom and catch a glimpse of yourself in the  mirror. You smile with a tear rolling down your cheek. You notice your  teeth are smeared with shit.

""I wouldn't have it any other way."" You think to yourself.

You proceed to go on Reddit to post about the new Solana outage and check what new features are coming soon to Cardano.

You look right into the camera. After a long pause you smile and shout ""Hail Hydra"" at the top of your lungs.

The  camera zooms away from your face and out of your RV thats parked in  front of your step dads house and the credits start rolling.

We live in one of the most expensive cities in North america. Average two/three bedroom townhouse here is about 900k. We have finally saved up 15% of a down payment (other 5% covered) and we would love to get into the market before our family expands and before the inevitable interest rate hikes in the new year.

Most of the holding is in ETH. We're kind of going sideways with price right now but I would still cover the down payment if I pulled today at a recent low (4800cdn). 

My question is, if even 1% of an interest rate hike means an extra $100k on a mortgage, is holding for 6 months to a year to see a possible 10K eth a smart move? Am I basically gaining more crypto but paying more for a house as the rates go up? 

I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. A lot of hard work got me to the single goal that most crypto apes hold for, a house, but now I'm finding it impossible to pull the trigger. Also I don't know shit about fuck and she's probably smarter than me.

[The idiocy of newbies FOMO-ing into anything with low nominal value lead to endless twitter timelines like this](https://i.imgur.com/zDjmRjl.jpg), and now nobody has any idea where the market settles. What do you do now? 

In the following weeks it will be a good time to rethink your investment approach and how you arrive at your decisions. Just buying whatever is shilled on Twitter or Reddit and jumping from one crypto to another isn't going to work like it did these last two months. 

The good news is that we're finally back closer and closer to our long term moving average which is much more healthy for entrants, the bad news is that the fear might continue compounding if outstanding issues are not dealt with. [Tether is the big concern for me personally for reasons I've stated many times](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7tg8fn/tether_drama_tether_has_dissolved_relationship/dtco50g/), but some relief in the short term may come if the SEC and CFTC meeting on February 6th goes well. Nobody really knows where the bottom is but I think we're now past the ""irrational exhuberance"" stage and we're entering a period of more serious inspection where cryptos will actually have to prove themselves as useful. I suspect hype artists like CryptoNick and John McAfee will fall out of favor.

But perhaps most importantly use this as a learning experience, don't try to point fingers now. The type of dumb behavior that people were engaging in that was rewarded in a bull market (chasing pumps, going all in on a shillcoin, following hype..etc) could only ever lead to what we are experiencing now. Just like so many people jumped on the crypto bandwagon during the bull run, they will just as quickly jump on whatever bandwagon is to be used to blame for the deflation of the bubble. Nobody who pumped money into garbage without any use case will accept that they themselves with their own investing behavior were the real reason for the gross overvaluation of most cryptocurrencies, and the inevitable crash.

So if you're looking for a fresh start after the massacre (or just want to get in now), here is a guide:

#Part A: Making a Investment Strategy
---------------------------

This is your money, put some effort into investing it with an actual strategy. Some simple yet essential advice that should apply to everyone, regardless of individual strategy:

1. Slow down and research each crypto that you're buying for at least a week.

2. Don't buy something just because it has risen.

3. Don't exit a position just because it has declined.

4. Invest only as much as you can afford to lose.

5. Prepare enter and exit strategies in advance. 

First take some time to think about your ROI target, set your hold periods for each position and how much you are actually ready to risk losing.

**ROI targets**

A lot of young investors who are in crypto have unrealistic expectations about returns and risk. A lot of them have never invested in any other type of financial asset, and hence many seem to consider a 5-10% ROI in a month to be unexciting. 

But its important to temper your hype and realize why we had this exponential growth in the last year and how unlikely it is that we see 10x returns in the next year. What we saw recently was [Greater Fool Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory) in action. Those unexciting returns of 5-10% a month are much more of the norm, and much more healthy for an alternative investment class. 

You can think about setting a target in terms of the market ROI over a relevant holding period and then add or decrease based on your own risk profile.

**Example: Calculating a 2 year ROI target**

Lets say you want to hold for 2 years now, how could you set a realistic target to strive for? You could look at a historical 2 year return as a base, preferably during a period similar to what we're facing now. Now that we had a major correction, I think we can look at the two year period starting in 2015 after we had the 2014 crash. To calculate a 2 year CAGR starting in 2015:

Year  | Total Crypto Market Cap 
-------|------
Jan 1, 2015:|  $5.5 billion 
Jan 1, 2017:  | $18 billion

Compounded annual growth return (CAGR):  [(18/5.5)^(1/2)]-1 = 81%

This annual return rate of 81% comes out to about 4.9% compounded monthly. This may not sound exciting to the lambo moon crowd, but it will keep you grounded in reality. You can aim for a higher return (say 2x of that 81% rate) if you choose to take on more risky propositions. I can't tell you what return target you should set for yourself, but just make sure its not depended on you needing to achieve continual near vertical parabolic price action in small cap shillcoins because that isn't sustainable. 

Once you have a target you can construct your risk profile (low risk vs. high risk category coins) in your portfolio based on your target.

**Risk Management**

Everything you buy in crypto is risky, but it still helps to think of these 3 risk categories:

* Core holdings - This is the exchange pairing cryptos and those that are well established. These are almost sure to be around in 5 years, and will recover after any bear market. The Coinbase pairs (Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum) are in this class of risk, and I would also argue Monero.

* Medium Risk Speculative - These would be cryptos which generally have a working product and niche, but higher risk than Core. Things like ZCash and Ripple, relatively established history but still uncertainty over long term viability.

* High Risk Speculative - This is anything created within the last few months, ICOs, low caps, shillcoins...etc. Most cryptos are in this category.

How much risk should you take on? That depends on your own life situation for one, but also it should be proportional to how much expertise you have in both financial analysis and technology. 

The general starting point I would recommend is: 

* 50-70% for newbies in Low Risk Core, then you can go down to 30% as you gains confidence and experience

* Always try to keep at least a 1/3rd in safe core positions

* Don't go all in on speculative picks.

Some more core principles on risk management to consider:

* Diversify across sectors and rebalance your allocations periodically. 

* Consider using dollar cost averaging to enter a position. This generally means investing a X amount over several periods, instead of at once. You can also use downward biased dollar cost averaging to mitigate against downward risk. For example instead of investing $1000 at once in a position at market price, you can buy $500 at the market price today then set several limit orders at slightly lower intervals (for example $250 at 5% lower than market price, $250 at 10% lower than market price). This way your average cost of acquisition will be lower if the crypto happens to decline over the short term.

* Don't have more than 5-10% of your net worth in crypto.

* Have the majority of your holdings in things you feel good holding for at least 2 years. Don't use the majority of your investment for day trading or short term investing.

* Remember you didn't actually make any money until you take some profits, so take do some profits when everyone else is at peak FOMO-ing mode.

* Have some fiat in reserve at a FDIC-insured exchange (ex. Gemini), and be ready to add to your winning positions on a pullback. This should be part of your entry strategy.

* Consider what level of loss you can't accept in a position with a high risk factor, and use stop-limit orders to hedge against sudden crashes. Set you stop price at about 5-10% above your lowest limit. Stop-limit orders aren't perfect but they're better than having no hedging strategy for a risky microcap in case of some meltdown. Only you can determine what bags you are unwilling to hold.


You can think of each crypto having a risk factor that is the summation of the general crypto market risk (Rm), but also its own inherent risk specific to its own goals (Ri).

Rt = Rm +Ri

The market risk is something you cannot avoid, it is essentially the risk that is carried by the entire market over things like regulations. What you can minimize though the Ri, the specific risks with your crypto. That will depend on the team composition, geographic risks (for example Chinese coins like NEO carry regulatory risks specific to China), competition within the space and likelihood of adoption and other factors, which I'll describe in Part 2: Crypto Picking Methodology.


**Portfolio Allocation**

Along with thinking about your portfolio in terms of risk categories described above, I really find it helpful to think about the segments you are in. [OnChainFX](http://onchainfx.com/) has some segment categorization but I generally like to bring it down to:

* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc

* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc

* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc

* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc

* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment - VeChain, Walton, Factom...etc

* Promising Tech segment - NANO/Raiblock, Cardano...etc

Think about your [""Circle of Competence""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_competence), your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Your ability to properly judge risk and potential is going to largely correlated to your understanding of the subject matter. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? If you don't understand anything about the tech when you read the Cardano paper, are you really able to determine how likely it is to be adopted?

Consider the [historic correlations between your holdings](https://cointrading.ninja/correlation). Generally when Bitcoin pumps, altcoins dump but at what rate depends on the coin. When Bitcoin goes sideways we tend to see pumping in altcoins, while when Bitcoin goes down, everything goes down. 

You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you have over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. 


#Part B: Crypto Picking Methodology (Due Dilligence)
------------------------------------------

Do you struggle on how to fundamentally analyze cryptocurrencies? Here is a 3-step methodology to follow to perform your due dilligence:

# Step 1: Filtering and Research

There is so much out there that you can get overwhelmed. The best way to start is to think back to your own portfolio allocation strategy and what you would like to get more off. For example in my view enterprise-focused blockchain solutions will be important in the next few years, and so I look to create a list of various cryptos that are in that segment.

[Upfolio has brief descriptions of the top 100 cryptos and is filterable by categories](https://www.upfolio.com/100-coins-explained), for example you can click the ""Enterprise"" category and you have a neat list of VEN, FCT, WTC...etc.

Once you have a list of potential candidates, its time to read about them:

* Critically evaluate the website. If it's a cocktail of nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and poorly made, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. 

* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. 

* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts selling? Try to figure out who the whales are (not always easy!) and what the foundation/founder account is based on the initial allocation.

* Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?

* Search out the subreddit and look at a few Medium or Steem blogs about the coin. How ""shilly"" is the community, and how much engagement is there between developer and the community?

* I would also go through the BitcoinTalk thread and Twitter mentions, judge both the length and quality of the discussion.

You can actually filter out a lot of scams and bad investments by simply keeping your eye out on the following red flags:

* allocations that give way too much to the founder

* guaranteed promises of returns (Bitcooonnneeeect!)

* vague whitepapers filled with buzzwords

* vague timelines and no clear use case

* Github with no useful code and sparse activity

* a team that is difficult to find information on 

#Step 2: Passing a potential pick through a checklist

Once you feel fairly confident that a pick is worth analyzing further, run them through a standardized checklist of questions. This is one I use, you can add other questions yourself:

Crypto Analysis Checklist |
---------|
What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve? |
What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized? |
How big is the market they're targeting? |
Who is their competition and what does it do better? |
What is the roadmap they created and how well have they kept to it? |
What current product exists? |
How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional? |
Is there any new tech, and is it informational or governance based? |
Can it be easily copied? |
What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?  |

The last question is the most important. 

This is where the riskiness of your crypto is evaluated, the Ri I talked about above. Here you should be able to accurate place the crypto into one of the three risk categories. I also like to run through this checklist of blockchain benefits and consider which specific properties of the blockchain are being used by the specific crypto to provide some increased utility over the current transactional method:

Benefits of Cryptocurrency |
---------|
Decentralization - no need for a third party to agree or validate transactions. |
Transparency and trust - As blockchain are shared, everyone can see what transactions occur. Useful for something like an online casino. |
Immutability - It is extremely difficult to change a transaction once its been put onto a blockchain |
Distributed availability - The system is spread on thousands of nodes on a P2P network, so its difficult to take the system down. |
Security - cryptographically secured transactions provide integrity |
Simplification and consolidation - a blockchain can serve as a shared ledger in industries where multiple entities previously kept their own data sources |
Quicker Settlement - In the financial industry when we're dealing with post-trade settlement, a blockchain can drastically increase the speed of verification |
Cost - in some cases avoiding a third party verification would drastically reduce costs. |


#Step 3: Create a valuation model

You don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do:

**Probablistic Scenario Valuation**

This is all about thinking of scenarios and probability, a helpful exercise in itself. For example: Bill Miller, a prominent value investor, [wrote a probabilistic valuation case for Bitcoin in 2015](http://dev.lmminvestments.com/a-value-investors-case-for-bitcoin/). He looked at two possible scenarios for probabalistic valuation:

1. becoming a store-of-value equal to gold (a $6.4 trillion value), with a .25% probability of occurring
2.  replacing payment processors like VISA, MasterCard, etc. (a $350 million dollar value) with a 2.5% probability

Combining those scenarios would give you the total expected market cap: (0.25% x 6.4 trillion) + (2.5% x 350 million). Divide this by the outstanding supply and you have your valuation.


**Metcalfe's Law**

[Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. We can alter this to crypto by thinking about it in terms of both users and transactions:

For example, compare the Coinbase pairs:

Metric | Bitoin | Ethereum  | Litecoin
---------|----------|----------|----------
Market Cap | $152 Billion | $93 Billion | $7.3 Billion
Daily Transactions (last 24hrs) | 249,851| 1,051,427 | 70,397
Active Addresses (Peak 1Yr) | 1,132,000 |1,035,000 | 514,000
Metcalfe Ratio (Transactions Based)| 2.43 | 0.08 | 1.47
Metcalfe Ratio (Address Based)| 0.12| 0.09 | 0.03

Generally the higher the ratio, the higher the valuation given for each address/transaction.

**Market Cap to Industry comparisons**

Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. 

**More complex valuation models**

If you would like to get into more fleshed out models with Excel, I highly recommend Chris Burniske's blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an [equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto](https://medium.com/@cburniske).

[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done by Nodar Janashia using Chris' model ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit). 

You should create multiple scenarios with multiple assumptions, both positive and negative. Have a base scenario and then moderately optimistic/pessimistic and highly optimistic/pessimistic scenario.

Personally I like to see at least a 50% upward potential before investing from my moderately pessimistic scenario, but you can set your own safety margin.

The real beneficial thing about modelling isn't even the price or valuation comparisons it spits out, but that it forces you to think about why the coin has value and what your own assumption about the future are. For example the discount rate you apply to the net present utility formula drastically affects the valuation, and it reflects your own assumptions of how risky the crypto is. What exactly would be a reasonable discount rate? What about the digital economy you are assuming for the coin, what levers affects its size and adoption and how likely are your assumptions to come true? You'll be a drastically more intelligent investor if you think about the fundamental variables that give your coin the market cap you think it should hold.


#Summing it up
------------------------------------------

The time for lambo psychosis is over. But that's no reason to feel down, this is a new day and what many were waiting for. I've put together in one place here how to construct a portfolio allocation (taking into consideration risk and return targets), and how to go through a systematic crypto picking method. I'm won't tell you what to buy, you should always decide that for yourself and DYOR. But as long as you follow a rational and thorough methodology (feel free to modify anything I said above to suit your own needs) you will feel pretty good about your investments, even in times like these.

Edit 3: The wallet currently has 0 BTC. At the same time, Elon Musk claimed that Tesla has sold 75% of its holding.

That wallet currently holds over 117k BTC (valued at 2.6 billion USD). Nobody knows if this whale operates as an individual or an institution but it has been active for multiple market cycles.

Over the cycles, the whale has been rather accurate in the local tops and bottoms. During the summer lulls of 2021, it was accumulating. Then it started selling into Q4 of 2021. Some people keep 24/7 tabs on the whale's wallet activity using it as buy/sell signals. Sometimes the whale gets things wrong and loses (millions of USD ouch), but more often than not it gains huge.

Yesterday, somebody in the comments of some thread asked for an ELI5 on why US bond rates matter and what their relationship is with markets and economies. What I wrote ended up being more like an ELI12, and also ended up being quite long; in any case, I have decided to modify it a bit and turn it into its own post.

# What are bonds

First, an introduction on what bonds actually are.

Simply put, a bond is the ""asset side"" of governmental or corporate debt. When a government or corporation borrows money, the borrower now holds a liability, and the lender holds an asset, which is expected to return them their original investment (the money they lent) plus profit (interest) at some later date. A bond is basically a token that says some government or company owes you some amount of principal by some date known as the maturity date (usually 3 months to 30 years, depending on the type of bond), plus interest. Because bonds are a tokenization of debt, they can be easily traded in a liquid, open market, just like stocks. This means that the original lender does not need to be the person who is repaid when the bond matures; the repayment and interest simply goes to whomever holds the bond at the time.

There are two main types of bonds: corporate bonds, and government bonds.

Corporate bonds are the main way companies raise money, apart from selling shares.

Government bonds are how the government raises money to cover budget deficits (ie: when the government spends more than they have the tax revenue to spend, they borrow the remainder by selling bonds to whomever will buy them). If nobody is buying the government bonds, the interest will go up organically due to supply and demand until people are willing to buy them. Government bonds are often known as **treasuries**, and are broken down into three categories: treasury bills (short-term maturity), treasury notes (mid-term maturity), and treasury bonds (long-term maturity).

One of the main buyers of US government bonds is the Federal Reserve, which is the name of America's central bank. This is the entity that is able to actually print US dollars. Everyone has heard of things like how the US government recently ran huge deficits due to ""stimulus spending"", and that it printed the money it needed for that spending. Well, this is a slightly inaccurate picture of how it works. The government chooses fiscal policy, which means they build the budget and they set the tax rates. They are the ones who choose to overspend and run a deficit. However, they don't choose monetary policy: they cannot print money. This power was delegated by congress to the Federal Reserve over 100 years ago.

So, when the government runs a deficit, they sell bonds to borrow the money. If the FED chooses to, it can print a whole bunch of money and then lend that money to the government (ie: the taxpayer) by buying the government bonds with it. That is how newly printed money actually gets into the economy: the FED prints it and then lends it out to companies and to the government by buying corporate and government bonds. When the FED buys a bunch of treasuries (government bonds), it is really lending out freshly-printed cash to the American people (since the government's liabilities are really the taxpayers' liabilities), and the people then owe that money, with interest, back to the FED by the time the treasury matures.

When the FED decides to buy up the government's bonds in order to lend to the taxpayers the money that congress is spending, they are also putting downward pressure on the bond interest rate. This is because, if the FED decided *not* to lend a bunch of money to the government to cover its deficits, the bond interest would organically rise through supply & demand until other buyers (individuals, companies, foreign investors, whatever) are willing to buy those bonds.

So, when the FED wants to keep bond interest low, they achieve this indirectly by creating what is basically artificial demand for US bonds by buying a ton of them with money that they printed at no cost to themselves. Due to how supply & demand works with debt, the more demand there is for bonds, the lower the interest those bonds offer.

So, the Federal Reserve executes its main task of managing the US bond rate by choosing how much government debt it buys. If they want bond rates to go up, they will print less cash and buy fewer bonds. If they want it to go down, they will print more cash and buy more bonds.

The FED is essentially a whale with the power to print money, who uses said printed money to manipulate the US bond market, ostensibly for the good of everybody.

# The risk-free rate

The interest rate on American government bonds is considered one of the most important variables in the American (and even worldwide) economy. This is because the American gov is considered the de-facto safest borrower of all borrowers in the world. In other words, if I buy an American government bond, I am lending my money to the entity that is considered to have the smallest risk of defaulting in the world (maybe this is arguable, but regardless this is a premise that is at the core of the world economy; what's important is that people believe it).

There is a concept in economics called the ""risk-free rate"". This is the interest you can get for lending your money to a 0-risk borrower, and should logically be the lowest interest rate you see anywhere in that economy. Of course, there is always technically some risk when you lend money, so the risk-free rate is technically imaginary. However, in practice, just about everybody considers the US bond rate (specifically, treasury bills, the US bond with the shortest maturity) to be the risk-free rate, as the risk is considered to be so low as to be negligible.

So, if buying American gov bonds is the safest way to lend money, it means that every single other form of loan must pay higher interest. Why? Because every other borrower is considered higher risk, and for me as a lender, I will not accept less interest for greater risk. So, if American bond interest goes up, all other loan interest (corporate bonds, bank loans, mortgages, credit cards, whatever) will organically go up, because everything must pay greater interest than American bonds to compensate for greater risk. This is simply a matter of supply & demand mechanics.

So, American bond interest is kind of like the baseline or the ""sea level"" for all interest rates in the entire economy. This even stretches to other countries, because anyone can buy a bond from the US gov, and they are considered the safest borrower in the world, so nobody will ever lend money to anybody else unless they are compensated with greater interest than US bond interest.

# The cost of capital

So, if US bond rates go up, and therefore all interest in the economy goes up, that means money itself has gotten more expensive. Loan interest is literally just the cost of money (known as the cost of capital). The lesser the interest, the cheaper it is for me to acquire money right now. When you realize that the entire world runs mainly on debt, it becomes clear how significant this phenomenon is.

So, when US bond rates go up, the price of capital itself goes up. That means it becomes more costly for businesses to raise money, more costly to mortgage a house, more costly to open a line of credit to buy investments, more costly to spend with credit cards, more costly to use leverage in securities markets, etc.

This means that growth goes down, spending goes down, wages go down, etc. It also means the prices of goods go down (or at least climb slower), because people aren't willing to pay as much, since capital itself is more expensive to acquire.

What happens when prices go down? Well, that's a reduction in inflation. So, when inflation is getting too high, the FED (central bank) will make bond interest go up to apply recessive forces on the economy to curb said inflation.

If inflation is low, the FED might reduce bond interest in order to make the cost of capital lower to juice the economy, prop up securities markets, and incentivize growth. Too much growth though, and we end up with inflation again, meaning the FED might increase rates again. This causes a sort of wave-like dance between bond rates and the heat of the economy.

So, the FED influences bond rates ostensibly to keep the economy balanced: not too hot and inflationary (can be very bad) and not too cold and deflationary (also can be very bad).

It is also worth noting that the FED wields a couple other levers it can use to increase or decrease the cost of capital (ie: the general interest rates in the economy) that are separate from bond rates. They can change the reserve requirements of banks (what percentage of total assets a bank must hold in reserve). If banks need to hold more in reserve, then they have less liquid money to lend out, so the supply of capital goes down, so market interest (cost of capital) rises. Also, the FED can change the discount rate, which is the amount of interest they charge banks for short-term loans (24 hours or less) from the FED itself.  When these rates go up, banks are disincentivized from borrowing from the FED, so the banks end up with less liquid capital, which means they need to be more conservative about the loans they themselves give out, which makes the supply of capital go down and thus the cost of capital go up.

# What does this mean for markets?

When bond rates go up, most investment markets go down. Why? Well, the higher bond rates go, the more I can make by investing in bonds, without the risk going up. So, as bond rates go up, it becomes more and more attractive to move my wealth out of riskier markets like stocks and into what is considered the safest investment market in the world: US bonds. Since rates going up means I get greater returns on my bond investments, but the risk doesn't change, US gov bonds become more and more sensible to an investor as the rates increase.

Of course, bonds rates going up a smidgen doesn't actually suddenly make bonds a strategically more sound investment than riskier things like stocks. In fact, US bond rates have been so comically low for so long that it hasn't made much sense to buy bonds in years (decades, really). However, when people hear that the FED is going to increase bond rates, they think ""bond rates going up means people will sell stocks to buy bonds, so I better sell now to front-run that"", which is the main thing that *actually* causes stocks to fall when bond rates increase.

How crypto will fare with increasing bond rates is unknown, because rates have been declining ever since BTC was born, until very recently. Personally, I imagine crypto will follow stocks down if rates go up too much, but nobody knows for sure.

# Some historical context

US bond rates hit an ATH in 1981 around 15% (edit: some sources seem to say 20%; unsure which is correct). Unsurprisingly, the stock market hit a low at the same time (like I said before, the orthodox narrative is that there is an inverse relationship between bond rates and most securities markets). Think about how ridiculous 15% bond rates are. That would mean you could buy what is definitionally the safest investment available and get 15% returns each year. By contrast, the safest stock ETFs (still way riskier than US bonds) average like 7% a year.

So, in the 80s, you could double your money every 5 years while accepting what is usually considered 0 risk. Ever wonder why boomers seemed to get wealthy so easily? This is one of the reasons.

Since the ATH in 1981, the treasury bond rate has fallen continuously until Covid hit, at which point it pivoted at a low of about 0.5%. Since then, it has been going back up, but is still extremely low, at around 1.5%.

Since bond rates going down means stocks go up (at least, this is a very popular narrative, though some disagree), the stock market has been in a tremendous and arguably unnatural bull run for about 40 years, only pausing twice very briefly for ""corrections"" circa 1999 and 2008.

Since US bond rates have gotten so close to 0%, they can't really lower them any further without going negative (which is actually a thing, and some countries are trying negative interest now. This is an extremely weird rabbit hole that nobody really knows the true consequences of yet. Imagine getting paid to borrow money. Several countries have been experimenting with this over the last 7 years, and a few I believe for even longer). The chair of the FED (Jerome Powell) said a few months back that they have no intention of going to negative interest rates, so that means these past 40 years of propping up markets by reducing bond rates has probably come to an end.

You could think of the continuous lowering of rates for the last 40 years as the FED spending its ammunition to prop up markets and propel economic growth, but now that rates are barely above 0% and the FED isn't willing to go negative, they are out of ammo. Not only are they out of ammo when it comes to lowering the rates, but one might also argue they are also currently incentivized to *increase* rates to combat rising inflation.

This is why there is fear. The FED has been sticking its hands in for 40 years to prop up markets, and now it seems they are going to stop, at least for now.

Do you really think anything changed?",5998,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/,2337,"The main focus throughout the bear market was the development of the Ethereum ecosystem. That is why the most popular dApps are all currently comfortably situated on the Ethereum main network. Yes, Ethereum's price dumped during the bear market as well, but the OGs in the space and all of the developers kept their eyes laser focused on the development happening within the Ethereum ecosystem.

I personally believe there are several solid alternatives to Ethereum (Polygon, Avalanche, Solana), but unless such networks have built a bridge to Ethereum, they likely will not survive. That is why all of the chains I mentioned were forced to develop bridges to Ethereum because no developer in their right mind would leave the Ethereum ecosystem for a risky sidechain or other layer 1 network. I do not think Cardano will be any different, but this is just my opinion.

Unless someone can tell me otherwise, I am not aware of any actively used dApp that has committed to migrating from other chains to Cardano. Unless you see the likes of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, Synthetix, USDC, and Yearn talk about migrating to Cardano, there really isn't anything to talk about with regard to ""Cardano killing Ethereum"". Hint: they'll never migrate.

I'm posting this because I'm getting sick of the manic Cardano threads where bagholders are desperately trying to get others to buy so the price goes higher and they can sell. Yes, they are scheduled to release smart contracts soon, but the biggest question remains, ***who is going to use their platform***? I have seen extraordinarily innovative developments being made on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and those did not happen overnight and it's hard to imagine people just packing up their bags and leaving to work on Cardano.

To all of the people about to yell at me for making another ""Cardano is overhyped post"" I want you to take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror: have you ever actually *used* Ethereum? Polygon? Avalanche? Solana? Have you ever actually *used* a decentralized exchange, lending protocol, NFT marketplace/game, or provided liquidity to these networks? I have. I've done all of it. So do you really have the perspective to be arguing about ""Ethereum killers"" and how ""great"" Cardano will be when you don't even have experience with engaging and interacting with smart contracts?

Where is all of your hype really coming from, the echo chambers on Twitter and Reddit? I'm asking because I fell for the same ""academic scientific approach"" marketing in 2017 and it's just the same cycle over and over again - Cardano is great at making money during bull markets, but not very good at delivering promised products, but I really hope I'm wrong this time.

!remindme 8 months

EDIT: Maybe some users in the comment section can look at one another and realize that there is not a single rebuttal to my points (removed technical because one user is right, I didn't really provide ""technical"" arguments). Every post is about price action. Will Cardano potentially make you some money this bull run? Sure, that is, if you aren't stuck holding bags while everyone sells the top. But please, let's stay on topic. Present some counterarguments related to the actual utility of the network.

EDIT 2: People should be aware that there was very similar hype surrounding Cardano leading up to the Coinbase [listing date](https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-launching-on-coinbase-pro-694b1cb8c778?gi=2495f7011d1c) (March 16-18), and the hype pump peaked at 1.38 (ATH at the time) on March 17, dumped to 1.24 (-10%) by March 18, and continued to dump to 1.06 (-25%) by March 24. Sure, it kept going up, and we may see a similar ""pump, dump, pump"" related to the smart contract release, but the ""pump"" following the ""dump"" all depends on execution and whether people actually care to use Cardano's platform.

EDIT 3: Thanks to a great comment by u/BornToBeHwild, I learned that Cardano is already developing and supporting an Ethereum bridge ([https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/)), which proves my point entirely - Cardano won't ""kill everything in this space"", they are already building measures to integrate with the existing ecosystem and adapt, so maybe it's time to stop saying it will end all of the progress that has already been made in decentralized finance and media and take over the world.

EDIT 4: I realize that my post is very triggering and I will edit the language a bit to emphasize the points I'm trying to make and remove some of the more triggering elements. Sometimes you forget in all of the mania that people have money at stake and I by no means am trying to ""FUD"" Cardano. I have friends and family who own this coin and I actually like Charles as he introduced me to a lot of the concepts I learned about in this space through his videos and lectures. I hope Cardano succeeds.

The point of my post was that people need to understand there already a ton of great, functioning products out there that all promised similar ""Ethereum killing"" capabilities that ultimately had to adapt and integrate with Ethereum in order to remain relevant and I do not think Cardano will be any different (see EDIT 3). Just trying to set expectations, especially for newcomers who are probably feeling FOMO for Cardano and are tempted to buy it while it's up x2 it's 2017 ATH and at the peak of its bull run. I'm not saying it won't go higher, but I do think the mania can be harmful for people who are just getting into the space now.

EDIT 5: I want to bring attention to a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vgije?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in this thread made by u/Bwahehe, which is not getting enough upvotes and perfectly articulates the point I am getting across:

>ETH is like Manhattan. Horribly crowded with insane traffic, but they're doing a ton of business.  
>  
>Cardano is like someone selling a potentially lucrative spot of land but absolutely no businesses are there yet. They promise that they'll finish the roads in a month or two but they'll be some damn amazing and scientifically proven roads.  
>  
>Most up and coming smart contract coins promise massive highways and roads but nobody knows if the roads and bridges are really safe to drive on and only hydrogen powered vehicles approved by them are allowed on the roads.

EDIT 6: I'm trying to respond to everyone but this is exploding... Also, I keep getting accused of ""missing"" Cardano or ""buying it high"" or something. Guys, look at my username. [I'm all about The Graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owryqy/why_the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/) (GRT).

EDIT 7: I've been reading more and being a bit more selective about commenting back since there are just too many to keep up with and every time I refresh there's 50 more, but I'm really happy to see that the comments have shifted from price to actual discussion. Great to see! This is what r/CryptoCurrency should be all about! I like ADA, I like Charles, I want it to succeed for reasons I mentioned above.

This isn't meant to be a tribalistic war-igniting trigger post. I just think it's time to have real discussion on this sub and Cardano is the hottest topic because it is leading the bullrun in gains. Stop getting so bent out of shape, my post is not going to cause Cardano to dump, nor is it an attempt to provoke a dump. I think this is a great place for newcomers and old schoolers to join one another and discuss what they know. It's also a great opportunity for Cardano followers and supporters to counter my arguments and present their points and why they believe in the project - remember, I have not really kept up with Cardano since 2017, so I can totally be wrong about a lot of things and I accept that! The point is, this thread was a success because it reminded thousands of users here that we can still engage in high level discussions and not everything has to be about price and driving lambo rockets to the moon.

Just want to thank a few posters for their great comments including  u/orangeblack07 ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vtoat?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/todayismycheatday ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vsq6t/?context=3)), u/cali_dave ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vogw9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/OhIamNotADoctor ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vnxer?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). There are so many great comments, but as you can imagine, my inbox is absolutely obliterated and I need to go to sleep lol, so give these guys the upvotes they deserve!

EDIT 8: Last edit (I hope). Some great discussion ultimately ensued and I appreciate everyone who made thoughtful posts. I definitely don't appreciate the attacks on my character and assumptions about who I am as a person, but I guess that's part of making controversial posts like this. Had no idea it would blow up so much and did my best to answer as many comments as I can. I really hope everyone knows that I do like ADA, I do like Charles, and I hope Cardano succeeds (though I think I've already mentioned this in another of my 45 edits). I was just hoping to stimulate some actual discussion on a subreddit that is in dire need of it. Thanks for engaging me. Till next time!

EDIT 14: Lots of great comments actually made me realize I don't know the first thing about what is going on with Cardano at this point in time, I'm not ashamed to admit it. There's a lot more going on than I thought there was! I listed some of the good comments that pointed me in the right direction above in EDIT 6. Maybe I'm wrong about Cardano, maybe the slow and steady wins the race philosophy will prevail! Who knows. I'm just glad that there were so many newly introduced perspectives in this thread hidden between the shill and anti-graph\_marine brigading. I'll be eagerly awaiting the launch of their smart contract platform and dApps so that I can dabble with them myself.

Thanks again to everyone who provided quality discussion and also to anyone who gave me awards, you really didn't have to do that!

tl;dr (for those who want one) - Cardano has taken a very long time to release a product while others have thrived. People only seem to talk about Cardano during bull markets when the price is going up and I want to have a discussion about how people can think it is the end-all-be-all smart contract platform when it still doesn't have a working product. Discussion ensues. Some posters create great counter arguments and provoke thoughtful discussion while others brigade me with hateful spam.",2021-08-22 04:03:49

512,"Indian government announces it will bring crypto under legal framework, taxable at 30% of gains. No capital losses or business expenses allowed",5987,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/shomjg/indian_government_announces_it_will_bring_crypto/,2032,"Indian government just announced that crypto will be taxed at 30% of gains. This is the first time the Indian government is discussing crypto taxation. 
The tax will apply to all gains on digital virtual assets, and no capital losses will be allowed. Business expenses will also not  be allowed.

Gifts in the form of digital currency will be also taxed in the hands of the receiver.

This is a landmark announcement as the first time the Indian government is announcing any law or regulation around crypto. So far nothing concrete was announced except rumors in the media. 

Now crypto being a taxable asset will lead to growth of adoption of crypto in India

> I propose to provide that any income from transfer of any virtual digital asset shall be taxed at the rate of 30%. No deduction in respect of any expenditure or allowance shall be allowed while computing such income, except cost of acquisition: FM Nirmala Sitharaman


Edit : Some sources are saying capital gains losses is not allowed only for offsetting it with other income sources. But it is still allowed within crypto. Waiting for more clarity on this.

Edit 2: ~~It seems completely no capital losses.~~ https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/memo.pdf

Law mentions ""aggregate income from crypto transfers"" - some seem to think this means crypto losses can be offset among crypto itself. 

> However, no deduction in respect of any expenditure (other than cost of acquisition) or allowance or set off of any loss shall be allowed to the assessee under any provision of the Act while computing income from transfer of such asset

> Further, no set off of any loss arising from transfer of virtual digital asset shall be allowed against any income computed under any other provision of the Act and such loss shall not be allowed to be carried forward to subsequent assessment years.


Edit 3: Most reaction seem to suggest 30% is really harsh. Especially when long term capital gains from stocks is like 10%. 30% will apply for developers and builders too, which will mean they will move to friendly tax jurisdictions rather than remain in India. Seems like a dumb and self defeating policy tbh.

The law taxes not profits but even transfers. So even simple actions like staking or moving funds or using a smart contract would become taxable. This is insane. Projects that originated in India like Polygon are already moving out, experts say most crypto companies will follow suit as a crypto native company doesn't want to deal with 30% tax for every transaction they make

Taxation is at 30% of gains if you are investing. If you are earning 100% of your income through crypto (lots of Indian freelancers/developers are, the tax will be at 30% of total income, which is definitely harsh)

Edit 4: CEX like WazirX and CoinDCX will now automatically report trades to the tax authorities as TDS. This is similar to other TDS tax deducted at source policies.  So if you are using them the gov will now automatically find out about your trades. 

While the tax provisions are definitely bad for Indian users, it creates clarity so now some rich guy with a few millions to spare who was interested in crypto, but waiting on the sidelines wondering if it will be totally prohibited or not can start investing as they know its not prohibited but taxed heavily. Could lead to more Indians getting in (i.e. Le india pamp)


**TLDR: Govt is taxing all crypto transactions including simple transfers at a flat 30% tax. No capital losses or business expenses allowed. In the same day, govt reduced corporate taxes to lowest in Asia, and offered loan and debt waivers for corporates. Fuel prices are soaring. There is literally nothing in this budget if you are middle class common person. If you run a billion dollar company, well there are few sops in it. Someone earning their income through crypto will get shafted. Massively anti-poor/anti-middle class, pro-elites, pro those who fund this sham government headed by dictator Modi. Honestly, fuck this.. I hope they get routed in the upcoming elections but wont have high hopes as most of the country has been sucked into their hate fuelled religious brand politics**",2022-02-01 06:55:17

So, are there any news about that?? Did the concurrency problem get resolved? If yes, why are there no functioning dexes on Cardano yet? Can someone from the Cardano community enlighten us please?",2021-11-24 14:53:39

He recently bought the dip. 

[However as the dip dipped, he has changed his profile picture. ](https://preview.redd.it/goninpvicdd81.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5dac20d1b67f6706d4bc173e3858a6e6e7c043c8)

Atleast he is owning it. Though some will say its not his money, its his country's money, but a lot of El Salvador's economy now depends on Bitcoin - from volcano mining, and now their bitcoin bonds that are going to be issued for raising funds after El Salvador showed the finger to IMF. 

Some people take hard and painful decisions in these times, that can cause pain to family and friends. Its worth remembering that money is not everything. 

If you have lost an obscene amount of unrealised gains, its best to make peace with it than to keep beating yourself up over it.

Edit: LOL so many people embarrassing themselves and crying in comments. Looks like after this crash, a sense of humor is out of their budget

Edit 2: The hot takes here from a lot of trolls coming in from other subs like r/technology are ridiculous. Let El Salvador/Bukele do what he wants to do, give him the time to decide if the experiment has failed or not. If it fails, so be it. I mean thousands of government policies have failed. 

He isnt buying BTC to get rich over night. Its a long term policy decision for him. While you claim he is wasting tax payer money, he is actually putting his reputation on the chopping block here, which is more than anything you can claim. If his economy collapses, its gonna be him on the opposite end of a coup or worse. That country is no stranger to presidents being overthrown in violence.

All the big brains here concerned about El Salvador's economy imploding all of a sudden, where were all of you 3 years ago when the nation was just the same, warn torn and filled with cartels? You didnt care then when the past presidents over ran the country with gang violence? Oh yeah, you didnt even know the country existed. Now that they are trying something new with BTC, it suddenly hurts your feelings so much. 

El Salvador have already started mining BTC from volcano energy that was being wasted, it represents a completely new income stream in a country that mainly depends only on tourism and remittances. Many reports already suggest the locals are able to save middle men fees by using BTC, while kicking out predators like Western Union. 
He has kicked IMF out, American media will do everything to portray him in a bad light and all you will parrot what you read in the media. 
Where were you guys when US Fed doubled the supply of USD in 1 year, printing relentlessly while other countries that depended on USD had no way to print any USD and had to bear the brunt of rampant inflation as they were hopelessly tied to USD? Of course, you never bothered to find out the reality of whats going on in other countries that used USD, while the Fed inflated it away. 
Now that he is trying something new to pivot away from BTC, and its not even been a year into a long term project, but you are ready to pass your judgements. 

Just a standard bunch of hypocrites. Nothing to see",2022-01-23 05:00:26

So as you can see, historically this has occurred 14 times since 2016.  In 2018 was the worse, because just when you thought you bought at the absolute lowest, the ATH actually shifts and every month it kept on dropping.

Median

the median months it took to recover is 4.9 months or  147 days. The lowest it dropped was 64.9% on 2018, Feb.

Here is a histogram.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR: buckle up; historically it takes **about 4.9 months or 147 days to recover from a drop of  -40-64%**. **The shortest it took was 2.9 months and the longest was 34.4 months to recover**.  The lowest it ever drop was on Feb 2018 about 64.9% and that took 1029 days to recover. The good news is that it will *likely recover again*.

***edit***: A few comments below observed that the recovery phase seems to be getting faster so plotted this this as well.

At the time crypto.com and their CRO coin had a bit of a bad reputation but I did my own research and determined that the things people were concerned about were growing pains and that an exchange with the domain crypto.com had a very bright future.

After getting my account approved I posted here asking for advice on if I should invest a substantial amount in CRO since I believed crypto.com was destined to become a major player like binance and that inevitably the CRO price would go up.

My post was met with lots of fud and responses from people who had likely been burned or knew nothing about crypto.com and CRO. I should have gone with my gut and my own research however I was brand new to crypto and didn't trust myself.

At this time CRO was about $0.06. Now CRO is $0.50+ and crypto.com has bought the naming rights to the arena where the Lakers play.

Moral of the story is 90% of what's posted here is garbage that won't help you make good investing decisions. Go with your gut.

532,"Yes, SHIB can go to a dollar",5827,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rlxsk8/yes_shib_can_go_to_a_dollar/,1514,"It has come to my attention that some people think SHIB coins cannot reach a USD valuation of $1.00, but let me assure you that this is *simply not true!*

A recent post explained that, for SHIB to reach $1.00, it would require a market cap of 558 *trillion* USD, about 500x the market cap of BTC. By comparison, as of 2021 the total wealth on earth is [431 trillion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2021/06/10/worlds-wealth-hits-half-a-quadrillion-dollars/?sh=2cf9123b309d) USD.

However, a 558 trillion USD market cap does not require 558 trillion USD worth of purchases. A [recent study](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/revealed-how-much-money-it-takes-to-move-bitcoins-price-by-1) by Bank of America found that 100 million USD could move BTC's trillion-dollar market cap by 1% - therefore, only 10 billion USD (1% of BTC's current market cap) would be needed to double BTC's market cap.

SHIB would only require 15 such doublings to reach a market cap over 500 trillion USD, requiring approximately 10 trillion USD in liquidity to do so. So, all we need is 10 trillion dollars - a perfectly reasonable amount of cash!

**So the question is, how do we get 10 trillion dollars?**

No problem, let me introduce you to my friend, [1998-KU2](https://www.asterank.com/#152679). 1998-KU2 is a 4.7km-wide asteroid mainly comprised of [nickel, iron, and cobalt](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/03/aa32086-17/aa32086-17.html). 1998-KU2's component minerals have an estimated value of 80 trillion USD!

[Here he is, circled in red.](https://preview.redd.it/yc2xy3tc21781.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2b3dd5c35e0d2d69e3f9e15b2eb6ce5a2f4a8486)

However, getting up there and mining those rare minerals won't be cheap - we'll need a rocket, mining equipment, a return vehicle, and some other seriously advanced technology. The estimated cost of all this is 70 trillion USD, leaving us with a healthy 10 trillion USD profit in cold, hard cash!

So all we need to do is go down to our local bank, get a small loan of 70 trillion dollars, build our rocket, swing by 1998-KU2, mine some minerals, return to Earth, sell the minerals for 80 trillion USD, repay our loan, place a SHIB buy order for 10 trillion USD, **and sit back and watch SHIB go to $1.00!**

ASAP.,5812,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/st424u/finally_got_all_my_crypto_off_robinhood_you/,1042,"I'll admit it: I've kept a large sum of my crypto on Robinhood this whole time... until now. To be fair, I had stopped actively buying with them a year ago, but had decided not to sell since they had announced they were developing crypto wallets. So I decided to just hodl until I could transfer out... and that time has finally come! Last night I finally received word that my wallet was ready. **As of this morning the remaining assets I has hodling have been transferred OUT!**

Screenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS](https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS)

**I STRONGLY urge you to do the same if you have not done so already.** It's worth the gas price too ([which is a little lower than normal right now](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price)). If you've quietly been waiting for your Robinhood crypto wallet, it should come soon. I was around number 55k in line to receive mine.

*Why transfer out?* If you're not aware, Robinhood restricted trades during the the GameStop/meme-stock mania last year which effectively helped shady hedge funds and hurt regular folk like you and I ([see more about that here](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/)). They were also fined $70M by FINRA over other shady practices, including having ""outages"" during big market swings between 2018 and 2020 ([check that out here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/technology/robinhood-fined-misleading-customers.html)). This was especially a frustration last year when Robinhood suddenly suffered ""technical difficulties"" during the epic Doge runup ([more info here](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419159/robinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash#:~:text=Robinhood%20confirmed%20that%20it%20experienced,the%20beginning%20of%20the%20day)). So then, it's pretty clear that Robinhood's interests are NOT with you. **Why trust them with your assets when they block you from making financial decisions during critical market movements?**

I'm not the only one in this sub that is alarmed by Robinhood, please see these additional posts and comments from our fellow sub-mates for more information so you can make your own decision:

I started out buying OMG and ANT (before it became NEO) back in 2017.  Those were the days!  The summer of 2017 was popping and thanks to my gains, I went from eating ramen straight out of the pack to using boiled water to soften the noodles.  Before my 2017 gains, my wife's boyfriend gained a lot of respect for me, and he even called me ""brah"" one day as he was picking up my wife for a hot date.  Man, I was on top of the world!

Fast forward to 2018, all my gains was gone.  Poof.  Overnight, I was back to eating ramen straight out of the pack.  I couldn't even afford the flavored ramen, just plain dry ramen with a generic label.  No brand names for me.  My wife's boyfriend went back to calling me Skid Mark instead of Regular Mark, and he never said ""brah"" to me ever again.  I was a loser.

The bear market was rough.  The crypto winter seemed like it would never end.  But I was diamond hands!  I hodled my coins and waited patiently.  Then, it happened!  The crypto winter was over and the bulls were back!  Life handed me a second chance!  My wife's boyfriend is back to calling me Regular Mark, and I think he's gonna call me ""brah"" again one day.  I can't believe how lucky I am!

To celebrate, I bought a pack of hot dogs and put hot dog slices in my ramen!  I still buy the non-flavored ramen cuz I want to save up and one day own a whole Satoshi.  But I believe in my dream!  And now my ramen tastes like boiled hot dog water, and I'm happier than I've ever been!

Everywhere I see ""you should diversify"", ""don't gamble all in one coin"", et caetera.

The thing is, whatever coin you pick (if it's not just a hypecoin); the token is still in its infancy stage on the market; and will mostly follow blindly granddaddy bitcoin footsteps in his charts.

In ten another years, yeah, we might see charts going their own ways, but as for now, diversification won't do much for you. In the cryptosphere that is. You may aswell get someting that offers you some sort of stacking rewards while you're at it, if you're in for the long haul, with a project you believe in.

Now if you tell me that you got some stocks on the side; a pile of cash or precious metals, THAT is diversification, and doesn't follow the same old chart.

Making it 50/50 between two cryptos, or more, won't save you in the bear.

Here is his testimony under oath where he said this  to the question ""Why did FTX fail"": https://twitter.com/Benzinga/status/1603076399593844736

Lets get this straight - he said FTX didnt fail because of fraud, laundering user deposits into personal accounts or into their own hedge fund to make risky trades, bought expensive condos with customer deposits and just ran the most incompetent bucketshop ever possible etc, but because ""Binance put FTX out of business""

In stark contrast, the main bankruptcy professional and new FTX  CEO John Ray told the House yesterday that FTX collapse was the result of old fashioned fraud. He was asked if Binance caused this, he flatly said NO. 

In the testimony to House, he was asked by Rep Gonzalez (at time 2:43:30),

> Rep Gonzalez: One of the things in Mr.  Bankman-fried's testimony that has  leaked, that wasn't submitted, is he spends time  talking about Binance and how Binance  created a run on the bank, suggesting that, had that not occurred, FTX was solvent and would have been just fine.  Prior to that episode -- is it your belief that FTX  was solvent? 

> Mr. John Ray: NO


You can listen to the testimony here and forward to the time mentioned above. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ObdFaUL7nc&t=9795s

Also this entire testimony of John Ray pretty much outlines how SBF was running a fraudulent shop for months. John who has now assumed control of FTX and is in an authoritative position to tell us what went wrong at FTX quite simply states the whole enterprise was a fraud. The DoJ, SEC and CFTC have already filed charges against SBF, but here we have Kevin O'Leary telling the Senate that SBF is innocent but its Binance put FTX out of business. 

Whats really dangerous is that Kevin knows this is not true, yet goes onto Senate to state lies under oath. He has worked his entire career in finance. He knows that John Ray has the best knowledge to put together what happened at FTX. He knows investigations of multiple agencies have put the blame on SBF. Yet he goes and tries to whitewash SBF's crimes. 

Kevin O'Leary is a conman, who last week even said he would continue to do business with SBF. This week SBF got arrested, yet Kevin is still lying to the Senate. He got paid $15 M to be a shill for SBF. Its a shameful joke that he was even called up to testify in this issue. Its like inviting Ted Bundy's spokesperson to the Senate so that he can whitewash his crimes. Such actions dont make Ted Bundy or SBF look any better, but it just diminishes the respect of the Senate as an institution. 

This guy deserves to be in the same cell as SBF. Every penny paid by SBF to this fraudster must be clawed back to make FTX depositors whole.",2022-12-15 09:24:34

Even if everyone in this sub chipped in with 10 USD$, it wouldn't even come close to whales' power. See this transactions just a few hours ago: "" 129,921,132 USDT (129,921,132 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to BINANCE "". That's over 30 USD for each one here! And that's just one Whale

TLDR: That's it boys and girls, you're a mere shrimp or algae in this crypto ocean, and the only real tool you have at your disposal is playing long term and not panic buy/sell, all the rest is playing with your luck and chances are you are going to get crushed by the whales",2021-11-28 21:51:05

It was too late for me to invest in GME as it already spiked, so I tried my luck with Doge and bought at 0.05€ for 50€. Not to be too risky with my first investment ever... 2 months later I cashed out (a bit too early) and made about 180€. So my total wallet was now €230, which I planned to invest in Doge again once the price dropped. 

Luckily the price stayed up and I realized that if I'd put my money back in Doge, I would only lose. Either the price stays up and I end up with less doge than I initially had or I buy when the price drops and end up with less € if it continues to drop. 

So I started looking for alternatives to invest my winnings. I searched for other ""cheap"" coins, that had a lot of potential to grow, by reading this subreddit and came across VET and ADA.  I gained some confidence by profiting from the doge investment and deposited another €500 into my wallet. I put €300 into VET and 350€ into ADA. I might put the remaining €80 back into Doge. It's an unpredictable meme after all, so who knows what happens. 

I'm planning to create a more diverse portfolio if my current investment works somewhat out. Doge might not be the most popular among the altcoins  in this sub, but it was a great starting point for me and made me interested in other crypto currencies.

Nosy neighbour? Spouse? Employer? Crypto scammers looking for targets? Blockchain analysis firms that can now put a name on self custody wallets? You name it.

And yes, this is a public court document, but man, why didn't they redact part of the names? Why did they put this on the internet? Why didn't at the very least give a heads up? Did they even give a fu\*k to do this properly?

This is probably one of the best examples of not your keys - not your coins. Not only will they steal your funds, they will also leak your information.

Edit:

1. It is confirmed that this list includes EU customers, so my guess is that's a global list.
2. The wife of former-CEO Alex Mashinsky was shown to have withdrawn $2 million in crypto on May 31. They stopped withdrawals 13 days later.
3. Many users in the comments have pointed out that this is standard procedure for Chapter 11 and that Celsius lawyers tried to avoid it but was rejected by a judge. For me, this remains a cautionary tale that not only can you lose your coin but also your private information. Why didn't Celsius notify us about this beforehand and couldn't they have taken a different legal route all together?

There was a post by Kraken founder about new Canadian legislation and I saw one very interesting and alarming reply on the comments. One of his followers just replied Jesse that Kraken may be put in position to freeze our assets without judicial consent and will probably comply to that request. Jesse just 100% agreed with that person and on top of that suggested to keep funds away centralized exchanges.

I think it's the first time we see any CEX CEO suggesting  to move away our funds from centralized custodians.  We should definitely appreciate the man for raising alarm and being so honest even though it may harm his business.

Now, I understand Nano came to be in a situation where smart contracts where not such a big thing, and there were no ""swaps"" and there was no staking/lending/liquidity pools etc. People want more from crypto and that's OK.

For the love of all that is holy, SAFEMOON should not be a word any of us remember in two years. 

Sure, there were two major incidents, both occurring in the bull runs, the exchange exit scam crap and the spam attacks now.  And sure, it was shilled here relentlessly. And people hate shillers. But how can a coins main fault be ""it's fan base is annoying""??

Take care everyone (even Safemoon holders).

**Edit 2** this has become my most upvoted post. I don't know what to say. Thank you to everyone, Nano fans and Nano haters.

Also, it seems Safemoon holders have figured out this post, so they started brigadding. Some had hilarious things to say about Nano (e.g. ""Out of #100 instant and feeless"" and ""Nano is very fast. Out of top 100hehe""). Laughs were had. Just to clarify, if Safemoon and SHIB start doing great things, there will be no one happier than me.

I've largely ignored SHIB, not even on fundamentals and it being a real coin or whatever, but even on a meme level, I thought DOGE has it beat, that it was just a copycat and won't have the history or community power of the original DOGE.

Of course, the SHIB shills are peddling the narrative that it will go to $1. 

Currently, one SHIB = $0.00002715

To go to $1, it has to go up by 3,683,141%. Yes, it has to go up by 3 million %... 

To go to even 10c, it has to go up by 362,884%

Apparently, there are 394,796,000,000,000 SHIBs in circulation. 


Even at 10c, the market cap of SHIB alone will be over $39 Trillion. 

To be specific, a market cap of Thirty-Nine Trillion, Four Hundred Seventy-Nine Billion Six Hundred Million dollars

Today, the entire crypto market cap is around $2.3 Trillion. So even at 10c, SHIB will be worth 20x today's crypto market cap. 

Firstly, this is not happening anytime soon. 

Secondly, this is not happening anytime in the future either.

There is a higher probability of SHIB going to zero over it going to $1 or even 10c. 

Hundreds of shitcoins bust onto the scene during a crypto boom cycle, only to disappear during the bust. 

SHIB is a token that has no real value, apart from exploiting amateur investors and unit bias and traders riding it for quick gains. Almost everyone is in SHIB purely for profit. Many want over night riches and plan to hold till $1, which they believe will come soon.. many others are riding it got quick gains, and there is nothing wrong in that. Many shitcoins can give quick gains. But for them to claim there is something innovative or anything resembling new technology in SHIB is just delusional.

You might’ve seen several posts explaining why keeping your coins in a wallet is the best way to hodl. This is true, if you have a significant amounts of a particular coin because then you will be able to cover the expenses of transfer fees which vary from coin to coin.

But with the rise of newcomers, not everyone can afford to buy large numbers of coins. And while you might be tempted to take your coins off an exchange, think about the amount you will spend for fees. For example the average fees for moving out ETH is 0.02 ETH (~$35) sometimes this is the amount most people have. Similar example can be applied to other coins as well. 

Another point is that exchanges are not un-secure anymore. They will store coins with high security measures. And you should enable things like 2FA to keep your account even more secure. So don’t worry about your coins being in danger.

If someone has any other suggestions please let us know.

Edit: Tips from comments:

1. From u/ACShreds - Gemini offers 10 free withdrawals per month so if you do want to withdraw coins, try buying from that platform although the fees are a little high compared to other platforms.

2. From u/thegooddocgonzo - Although exchanges aren’t fully safe, many big and reputable one like Coinbase and Binance will do everything to keep your coins safe because they don’t want any bad reputation. The user also notes that Binance was hacked in 2019 and Binance made sure that no customer was impacted. Stay cautious of smaller and unknown exchanges.

Edit 2: The withdrawal fee which I stated for ETH (0.02) was for the exchange I primarily use which is WazirX. I’m sorry for not mentioning the said exchange and for those asking where I got that figure here is your answer.",2021-03-04 04:31:05

We all have our favorite pet projects and argue about everything from proof of work versus proof of stake, to store of value versus medium of exchange. Some of us are into defi, for others its NFTs; maybe it's meme tokens that float your boat, or just plain old electronic cash.

But I like to believe we also all share something in common. We believe in the power of crypto. We believe in what it represents and what it can one day make possible. But it's not just going to happen on its own. The future isn't going to be handed to us on a silver platter and it's going to take as many of us as possible to fight the powers that be and make our voices heard.

I'm not proposing we take down the fed tomorrow, but what I am talking about is something much smaller, something I'm hoping you can help me set right.

The other day I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qyb6zt/an_open_letter_to_johnny_lyu_and_kucoin_exchange/) about the exchange Kucoin. I explained how they've been holding \~$50K of my BCHA (aka XEC on every other exchange) for over six months without letting me withdraw. I shared emails showing how they've given me nothing but the runaround since May, and how Kucoin themselves had [announced](https://www.kucoin.com/news/en-kucoin-will-support-bcha-upgrade-0820) their support of this project 3 months ago, causing me and others to buy even more.

[People's exchange my ass.](https://preview.redd.it/qwcsz21p09181.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d0e1f6afc3e1cbcfb929aa163acdd75efe6501a)

But they've failed to live up to their word.

While I was thankful to see so many kind and supportive comments, giving me hope for the crypto community at large, I'm sorry to say Kucoin still has yet to tell me when I'll be able to withdraw my coins.

To those who suggested I just sell my BCHA and withdraw in USDT, the fact is I can't because there is no liquidity left. Who wants to buy a coin on an exchange if you can't withdraw, and I hold enough coins that I would have to sell for cents on the dollar if I did. Not to mention I'd just be passing off the problem to some other poor soul.

But what's most important is that I shouldn't have to do any of that. And giving up would just be letting Kucoin off the hook, which I'm not about to do.

So I'm asking for help from the wider cryptocurrency community. I want to believe that people in this community, more than any other, understand the difference between right and wrong and believe in a sense of justice in this world.

I'm asking you to help me right this wrong, and share this post with as many people as possible. My goal is to reach the top of this subreddit and send a loud message to u/Johnny_Kucoin (Johnny Lyu, CEO of Kucoin) that his exchange can't get away with this.

At this point I know that \~$50K of my money is probably gone, but I want everyone in crypto to hear about this so they understand the type of exchange Kucoin is. Because if they can steal my money, there's nothing stopping them from doing the same to you.

I for one am tired of industry players who give crypto a bad name. It's time to call out bad actors and send a message to these companies that they must treat their customers right or we'll simply move our business elsewhere.

I know this is a longshot, but I'm asking you to spread the word, because I am confident that this space is full of amazing people who believe in supporting each other and holding bad actors accountable.

I'm not a vindictive person. I don't want Kucoin to go out of business. I just want them to do the right thing and make sure others aren't cheated out of their money like I was.

Thank you for reading and best of luck to everyone.",2021-11-23 04:02:06

Now I repost it without any information so please don't ask for it. Anyway the website is now deleted so you can't see anything.*

 I own a telegram group where this morning an user entered telling everyone to be quick because today it was starting the private sale of a new coin.

I looked at its website and it was clearly made by an amateur. It's whitepaper was a joke.

However, the devs officially doxxed themselves and most users in their ""official"" telegram group were starting to believe in this scam.

I noticed some users were clearly fake, saying things like ""I follow this project since 1 year and it's amazing"" but I checked and the **group was created just few days ago so how they were following this project since 1 year ago?**

I then decided to **contact on LinkedIn the 2 official admins of the project**. They both answered me that they had nothing to do with it and clearly someone took their names and photos and posted them on that website.

45 minutes were remaining before the private sale would start. By the way, the private sale was going to work in this way: they would publish a bsc address and everyone had to send bnb at that address. In exchange they would receive back 2000 of these new tokens.

I posted in their group that admins were liars and that the people listed in the official website were not related to this project in any way.

They accused me of fud, I had no proofs. Also they were deleting most of my messages. 

**Then I tried what I thought was impossible, because only the worst amateur would make such a mistake: I did a whois of the domain of their website** and found out the website was created just 2 days ago, and I found the name and the address of the owner. This guy didn't even think to hide it properly.

**At this point it was just few minutes before the official launch of the private sale. I simply posted in the group the name and the home address of the scammer and then ""if anyone will be scammed, just give this name to the police""**

Admins abandoned the group immediately, countdown went to 0 but no private sale started. They literally disappeared and they had no opportunity to scam anyone.

Obviously they were amateurs, it's harder with professional scammers, but I'm proud that I destroyed the plan of these scammers who invested money and time in creating their website and preparing this scam.",2022-02-08 06:55:55

Here’s some quotes from the article. Sauce at the bottom. 

“If we are looking at where Bitcoin is at now, Okung could be considered one of the highest salaried NFL players at this moment.”

“For instance, when BTC hit $44k, the half of his contract that is paid in BTC climbed to $10.59 million, at $56k+ his half turned into more than his entire quoted salary. As far as 2020 NFL salary stats are concerned, Okung has entered the top five position. However, the NFL has recently decided to cap the league’s salaries at $180 million and a ball player’s contract could change in 2021. Because the Carolina Panthers’ offensive tackle (OT) gets half of his salary in BTC, many proponents think of him as the highest-paid player in the NFL and not just ahead of the highest-paid OTs.”

“Money is more than currency; it’s power,” said Okung in a statement. “The way money is handled from creation to dissemination is part of that power. Getting paid in bitcoin is the first step of opting out of the corrupt, manipulated economy we all inhabit.”

“Okung went further into that statement adding: ‘When we are all paid in bitcoin, no one can tell us what to do with the value we create … In a post-fiat world, you won’t have to worry about your labor and time being stolen.”

This got me to thinking about the first time I heard of Bitcoin. I was a freshman in college and a computer science major. It was Fall of 2010. I was in the lab when a Sophomore csci major asked me if I wanted to help him set up the \~35 computers in the lab for mining Bitcoin.  His plan was to mine every night after classes ended until 8am when classes began again and 24 hours over the weekend.

Me, thinking it was a waste of time with Bitcoin being like $.06, said no. The guy ended up setting up the computers himself, mining \~2,000 BTC, and in 2013 when the price hit $1,000, sold half his stack to become a millionaire in college.

Credit is predatory by nature. The bank doesn't care when you max your card out on alcohol, designer clothes, gambling, or any other worthless and risky commodity. Your bank doesn't give one single tiny little shit about you in any way beyond your capacity to generate revenue. You are a revenue generating unit and nothing more, end of story. They are building artificial barriers to crypto because they view it as a direct and fundamental threat to their industries... and with good reason, because it is. The reality is anyone who invests wisely in crypto right now is going to make a significant ROI over the next few years, opening up the opportunity to pay off large balances, which decreases the revenue they earn from interest. This is nothing more than a desperate attempt at self preservation. 

Again I would encourage anyone who has their bank or credit card company create a barrier for them to purchase crypto, to immediately end doing business with that institution and make sure they know why. If my bank halts my purchases, I'll liquidate my account and close it the same day. Same goes with my credit cards, they will get cut up and never used again. DON'T bend over for them.

Otherwise, you will sound like a fool.",5358,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qyttdx/if_you_dont_already_you_need_to_understand_the/,689,"Return on investments are not expressed by months, weeks or days. They are expressed *annually*.

So when you say, ""*You can get 2% of APY/month*"", or ""*with a 1% interest/week*"", or ""i*f you coumpound interest on a 10% APY*"", then you sound like a fool.

There are two different acronym you *need* to understand.

**APR** : Annual percentage rate; it's the annual rate of return on an investment, **without any compounding**.

It's basically the return you realise by lending (or staking, etc.) an asset after a year, if you do not touch it (no compounding). So, if you invest $100'000 with a 10% APR, you will get a return $10'000 after a year (10%).

**APY** : Annual percentage yield ; it's rate of return earned on an investment, **taking into account the effect of compounding interest**.

It's the return you realise when compounding the interest whenever it's possible to do it. The compounding can take place daily, weekly, monthly, annually. It depends on the terms & conditions of your investment.

**Compound interest**: it's the fact the interest accrued on your investment is (automatically/manually) added to your investment and start accruing interest as well.

An APR where you can compound interest daily is going to be a much higher APY than an APR with monthly coumpounding.

Let's take a few examples:

* 12% APR. That's 12% per year (or 1% per month if you want). So if you invest $100, you get 12$ a year (1$ every month). After a year, you have $112.
* 12% APR allowing you to monthly compound. That's a 12.68% APY. So if you invest $100, you get 1$ the first month (that you coumpound), $1.01 the next month, $1.021 the third, $1.0303 the fourth, and so on.
* 18% APY with a daily compound, is a 16.56% APR.
* 45% APY with monthly compound, is a 37.18% APR.

If you want to understand how to convert your APR to your APY, you can head there: [www.aprtoapy.com](http://www.aprtoapy.com). There are also the mathematical formulas and explanations.

I hope that helps some of you to better understand the financial aspects your investments and use the correct terminology, so you don't look and/or sound uneducated.

People new to crypto often fall prey to the shillers offering millions of tokens at just $10 or so. The boom of dogecoin and it's peers have just added fuel to the sale of memecoins which are often scams or rugpulls. Even if they aren't, that doesn't mean it's a good investment.

The value and room for growth of any Cryptocurrency is determined by it's Marketcap. The market cap of a token is calculated by multiplying the value of one coin into the total supply of the coin.

If a coin has the value of $0.0001 a piece and the market cap of $100 billion and you buy a million tokens thinking it'll make you a millionaire someday, you are WRONG!
This token will NEVER go to $1. For it to reach $1 the market cap of the crypto would have to be $1 Quadrillion Which is IMPOSSIBLE! Even Bitcoin, the OG, doesn't have that marketcap. 

That being said, while checking the marketcap is important,if the token is deflationary you should check the minimum supply it will have in the future and then calculate it's highest possible growth.

If there is something I need to add or correct, please comment it.

Edit: Market capitalisation is obviously not the only criteria which can help us determine how much a coin's value can grow, but it is a good place to start. There are plenty other things such as total supply and max supply of tokens, fully diluted market cap, volume etc. 
One should always read the token's whitepaper to find all the details, check social media handles of the dev team and the official handle of the token (if they have any).",2021-12-10 07:44:12

Do Kwon just gave regulators the opportunity they have been gagging for to come in and absolutely rail the crypto industry and exchanges.,5324,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/v086c3/congratulations_lunatics_do_kwon_just_gave/,1222,"First off, the collapse of Luna caught the attention of regulators around the globe, especially in the USA. Stable coin regulation is coming and there is nothing anyone can do about it. I don’t actually think this is a bad thing to prevent future meltdowns (full audit of tether pls).

So what does this c#ck head do…….creates Luna 2.0. This is a regulators wet dream. The optics on this whole thing are so incredibly bad.

To ALL of the exchanges out there who listed this token……you fucked up. 

Not only do the regulators have hard on for flogs like Do Kwon, but you are in their crosshairs even more now. Exchanges literally listed the exit pump token for Do Kwon’s initial ponzi. Utterly psychotic. Like how can they be so stupid.

Exchanges should have denied the listing of Luna 2.0. 

This is why we are so far away from full scale adoption. It’s bullshit like this and maybe it’s time for the regs to come in and clean this bullshit up. A lot of people lost a lot of money in the last couple of weeks, Do Kwon is causing more and more damage every day he is active in the crypto asset class.",2022-05-29 10:12:46
599,"Why are so many of you people ""HODLing nomatter what""?",5323,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vc1z3j/why_are_so_many_of_you_people_hodling_nomatter/,2941,"I cannot understand the ""any selling is weak hands"" argument.  Why not spend a little more time paying attention to the economy in the short-term, so you can make proactive decisions about your investments? 

Here's a bit of reality for all you genius apes.  

The fed meeting is tomorrow and its going to be a .75 basis point hike.  First time since 1994.  Some of this is already baked into markets (I'm assuming you've realized by now that your stocks are down almost 10% and crypto is down 30% since Friday), but there is always more room to drop and more pain to come. 

A lot more.  

When JP pulls a switcheroo from .5 to .75 a mere 36 hours before the Fed meeting, you had better bed your ass that he'll open up the doors for more hikes at .75.  And he should.  A CPI at 8.6 is bonkers with a base funds rate of 1.5%.  It's borderline economic catastrophe.  Since the invention of the dollar, rate hikes have only successfully brought down inflation once they got within 2.5% of the inflation rate.  Get your calculator out bc that means if the inflation rate were to stay at 8.7 (yea right) it would take 6 more rate hikes to get us in the functional range. When he says that ""we are now considering .75 rate hikes in July and September, possibly higher"" you had better believe people are going to trade whatever they can for cold hard cash.  

And that's not all.  

You've probably heard of Quantitative ""Easing"".  That's how the Fed ""prints"" money into existence. They create the money on a magic computer and use it to purchase treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (those bundles of mortgages you heard Christian Bale and Steve Carrell talking so much about in The Big Short).  The Fed bought 3 boatloads of this stuff in 2008 (these purchases are referred to as the ""bailouts""), and up to now they've got about $8,500,000,000,000 worth.  That's trillion, with a T. 

Now we get to play a new game.  Quantitative ""Tightening"".  

Starting tomorrow (Wednesday for anyone late to the party), the Fed will sell $45,000,000,000 in assets onto the open market.  That's going to be a whole lot of pressure on markets to stay up and we all know people aren't exactly buying-hand-over-fist right now.  Their purpose is to bring markets down.  That, by definition, is fighting inflation.  Remember: price up = bad.  Price down = good.  

But the QT fun doesn't end there.  The Fed is going to sell another $45 billion in assets in July, and another $45B in August.  Then, they will increase the rate to $95 BILLION EVERY MONTH starting in September.  At that rate of monthly selling they won't run out of MBS for 7.5  years.  

Let's talk about those mortgage-backed securities for a second. Those bundles of thousands of mortgages we call MBS start out when you buy a house. Or when your cousin buys a condo to rent on Airbnb.  Remember when you finally closed on your house and 2 days later you received a letter saying that your loan was purchased by another lender?  ""Underwriting"" is your lender making sure there is a buyer ready and willing to buy this loan the moment you close on the property.  That's why you get the notice right away.  As you were figuring out to whom you should make your mortgage payment that new lender was bundling your loan with many others to sell yet again to a bigger bank.  The bundle grows each time and at some point they refer to them as MBS, and for some reason they are considered much more secure than individual mortgages.  They are given ratings like A, BB, CCC, etc.  Picture Ryan Gosling playing jenga.  Now when the biggest MBS customer not only stops buying but starts dumping MBS onto the market, you can imagine the demand for these bundles of joy will shift.  Soon smaller banks can't sell to bigger banks as easily as before. And eventually not at all.  This past Friday the market for MBS actually hit ""zero bids"" for the first time since 2008 (you might have seen a tweet from the actual Michael Burry).  As loans become harder to sell, will also become harder to write.  And we know what that will do to the housing market.  Remember: price down = good.  

Now you're getting it.  

Lastly, because my legs are asleep, you need to understand that most of the money that came into crypto since 2017 was not from people here on reddit.  Many of them do not share your diamond hands conviction, and their crypto investment doesn't represent an ""inflation hedge"".  It represents the riskiest thing they've ever done with their money.  Ever. Big risk = big reward.  And when both the stock market and the housing market get tumultuous, risk assest get sold first.  That is what you are starting to see. An almost perfect correlation between crypto and the Nasdaq, just where the swings in crypto gains and losses are exaggerated. 

Unfortunately we are probably one or two cycles away from certain cryptos being seen and used like the scarce resource inflation hedge that they really are.  

So here you are, with all this new knowledge and a bag of Shitcoin Potpourri.  And there is a train coming tomorrow that will last until at least through September.  

Good luck!",2022-06-14 12:04:50

601,How to Create your very own Shit Coin and become a Millionaire overnight!,5308,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uykd59/how_to_create_your_very_own_shit_coin_and_become/,1325,"So I like many of you have found my self looking less and less at the charts and trying to occupy myself with other things like work and sleep, both of those things get old pretty fast so I asked myself ""What If I made my own Shit Coin??""

The process is fairly easy and will cost you surprisingly little, the entire process cost me only 15 ALGOs and I could still withdraw most of that out of the wallet I created for this project. I decided to use Algorand for this due to it's ease of use and low fees.

# Step one: The Wallet

Create a Pera Wallet and transfer around 15 ALGO into it. (around $5.00 USD)

Pera wallet is available on Android and IOS, you can also use any other ALGO wallet you prefer.

# Step Two: Creating the Algorand Standard Asset

Head on over to [algodesk.io](https://algodesk.io) and connect said wallet.

click on the top right button labeled **create asset,** you will get the following box pop up. fill in the required information and confirm the transaction on you wallet. (this fee I believe is around 1 ALGO)

^(For this example I decided to create the shittiest shit coin I could think of so its called ButtCoinASA in honor of) r/Buttcoin

&#x200B;

# Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of your very own ALGO ASA

# Step Three: Providing Liquidity

So now you have this new asset in your wallet but its not really known to the world, what to do?

Visit Algorands best DEX called [tinyman.org](https://tinyman.org) then follow the steps below.

* connect wallet
* click on the tab labeled **pool**
* click create pair
* select Algo and (your new ASA), you'll have to search for it and click on the box labeled ^(""hide unverified assets"")
* &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p8seesx5jw191.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0fc12fa3a676dc6edc6903ebe9951a4d40467bd6

* now add as much ALGO and your ASA as you want (this will give it your initial value, if you add 1 ALGO and one ButtCoin then 1 ALGO = 1 Butt)
* Congrats, your ShitCoin now has some value
* wait about thirty minutes and then head on over to [tinychart.org](https://tinychart.org)
* &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gtfprjtvjw191.png?width=1659&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=42ab35ebbdce72ca5da16fc3efbbc26b3a548f15

* and look, your ShitCoin is now listed and shows a value.

# Step Four: Be A Millionaire

that's it

Your done.

You are now a Millionaire \*^(on paper)

So I created ButtCoinASA and I hold all one billion of them so if you multiply 1,000,000,000 x $0.0019 + 1.9 million dollars!!!!!

sure I cant cash it out because it only has $3.00 worth of liquidity but it does look like green on that chart to me so I'll take it.

&#x200B;

So there you have it boys and girls, you are now the owner of your very own bonafied Shit Coin.

What can you do with it? well what ever you'd like to

* share it with friends
* give it to strangers
* start some sort of reward system for your kids
* if your competent maybe even turn it into an actual project with some real uses and make some money
* the sky is the limit

&#x200B;

I avoided shady websites, apps that I didn't try personally, and those services that make you download shitty games and malwares. This list contains only trusted services, without any referral codes.

If you think I missed something, please share it in the comments so that people can check that out as well!

&#x200B;

**Coinbase Earn** **\[about $30 in different cryptocurrencies\]:**

This is one of the most popular ways, although it is not really the quickest. You need a Coinbase account and to complete verification (so photo + document). Once you are verified, you will be put on a waiting list that usually lasts a couple of days. 

Once you get accepted, all you have to do is watch a video explaining how a project works, and answer some questions about it. It is not anything hard and you can find the answers online.

Right now, you can earn XLM, COMP, CGLD, GRT, NU, but they often update it with a new project so definitely keep the account once verified.

[LINK](https://www.coinbase.com/earn)

&#x200B;

**CoinMarketCap Earn** **\[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Basically the same as Coinbase Earn, but hosted by CoinMarketCap. For this, you'll need a CoinMarketCap account (just needs e-mail and password) and a verified Binance account (which requires verification, but there's no waiting list once verified). 

The payouts are slower than Coinbase Earn, since they are distributed after weeks and not immediately.

[LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/)

&#x200B;

**Faucets \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

This is one of the easiest and most immediate ways to get a small amount of crypto. You just need a wallet that can hold the coin and the relative address, and you're good to go.

They're basically websites that distribute small amounts of cryptos to the users asking for it, and they're supported by donations/ads and stuff like that.

There are a lot and you can often find them just by searching on Google ""<name of the coin> + faucet"".

A [good read](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-crypto-faucet) about them and some examples: [freenanofaucet](https://www.freenanofaucet.com/) and [Doge Faucet](https://www.dogefaucet.com/en)

&#x200B;

**Airdrops \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

An airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. 

They can be free or they might require holding certain tokens or doing small tasks.

Airdrops happen on many different platforms and for many different coins, so it's often hard to find them if you aren't familiar with the community or the platform. Anyway, [Airdrops.io](https://Airdrops.io) is a good website that gathers the best airdrops happening.

&#x200B;

**Bounties \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

In the crypto world, it is a marketing strategy where an ICO allocates a percentage of their tokens for “bounties”. These are tasks that are open to the public to complete and their reward is the new token that is launching. Once the token is launched, participants of the bounty will receive their tokens. 

As you may have noticed, they're similar to airdrops. As airdrops, it is often difficult to find them. [This](https://beta.bounty0x.io/explore) is a good website that gathers some bounties that are currently active.

&#x200B;

**WeNano \[NANO\]:**

This is one of my favorites, so I encourage you to check them out since the project is awesome.

Have you ever played Pokémon Go? Well, this is a similar app, but instead of capturing Pokémon, spots are created by users around the world, and by visiting them you can earn NANO and chat with other users. The payouts are actually really good, especially in large cities, and the community around it is awesome.

[This](https://www.wenano.net/) is the official website (it's available both for Android and iOS)

&#x200B;

**NanoQuakeJs \[NANO\]:**

Another favorite of mine. It's literally just Quake 3, on your browser, and for each kill you get some NANO. I challenge you to find something cooler.

[This](https://nanoquakejs.com/) is the website, you just need a nickname and a NANO address and you're good to go!

There are some other similar projects, one of which is [PlayerKillers](http://playerkillers.exchange/), but I mean, Quake is Quake.

&#x200B;

**Reddit \[MOON, DOGE, NANO\]:**

Yeah, Reddit. There are actually a couple of ways to earn crypto on Reddit.

First, our favorite, MOONs. You just need to set up your vault (on the app) and you're ready to receive moons next distribution! They happen once a month, and a fixed amount of moons are distributed to the r/CryptoCurrency community, based on the Karma you gained that month. So start shitposting!

Other subreddits, like Dogecoin's and Nano's have bots that allow you to tip users, so if you make a good submission there you'll probably receive some coins from kind redditors. 

Also, subs like r/dogecoinbeg exist, where you can... Well... Beg for dogecoins.

&#x200B;

**Publish0x \[ETH\]:**

This is a really cool project that I personally love. It is basically a website like Medium, where users can post blog entries.

The best thing about this is that the website provides the coins. You will literally earn crypto just by reading content on the website (which is crypto-related), sharing content and writing it (although you'll need to apply as an author to do so).

[LINK](https://www.publish0x.com/)

&#x200B;

**SteemIt \[STEEM\]:**

Steemit is a blogging and social media platform that uses blockchain technology and a cryptocurrency to reward its users for creating content, commenting, and upvoting other posts.  

It is really similar to Reddit, [here](https://steemit.com/)'s the link

[Cent](https://beta.cent.co/~discover/) is another similar social network built on top of Ethereum, worth checking out.

&#x200B;

**NFT marketplaces \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Many websites offer the possibility to sell artworks, collectibles and in general NFTs. NFT, for the newcomers, stands for Non-Fungible Token, and means a token representing something unique. 

You can think of it as an art piece: although you can copy it, scan it and print it, there will only be one original copy. NFTs are used to verify and confirm the uniqueness of something and its ownership. So, let's say I make a beautiful digital painting, I can ""link"" it to this token and whoever owns the token, owns the digital painting and can therefore sell it or trade it.

[KnownOrigin](https://knownorigin.io/), [Mintable](https://mintable.app/), [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) are all great example of such marketplaces. If you're a creative person and want to sell some of your works, those are great places to do so. 

&#x200B;

**Games and Collectibles \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Many games run on a blockchain, using NFTs to create unique and rare in-game assets. Think of a card game like HeartStone: on the blockchain, it is possible to create only 10 cards of a specific type (using NFTs), so only 10 users in the world can own that card, so that card would extremely rare and therefore valuable.

Usually, it is not easy to earn crypto this way, you'll need to play a bit before getting some good stuff that you can sell, but if you find a game that you like you can surely earn while having fun!

Examples of games are [MyCryptoHeroes](https://www.mycryptoheroes.net/home), [EverDragons](https://everdragons.com/), [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) and [Brave Frontier Heroes](https://bravefrontierheroes.com/).

Some aren't even games at all, just collectibles that you can buy, trade and earn. Examples are [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/catalogue) and [Clovers](https://clovers.network/)

&#x200B;

Endnote: especially services using NFTs on top of Ethereum are, right now, subject to really high fees that make it often impossible to trade these tokens effectively. Be careful when doing a transaction.

Some I forgot or didn't know about:

608,"If crypto has stopped you caring about other elements of your life, you need to urgently reconsider things...",5265,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m6wvqo/if_crypto_has_stopped_you_caring_about_other/,614,"I get it.

When you're in the middle of a bull market and prices continue to rise, it's easy to think that other, more traditional methods of income are a waste of time. Your salary suddenly seems inconsequential and other investments are boring as hell.

We often talk about not putting all your money into crypto, but there's another element to this too - you shouldn't dedicate all your mental energy to crypto either.

When the next bear market comes, and it will come at some point, having nothing in your life except crypto and your portfolio app is going to make for a very depressing period.

Even if you're making paper profits of 10k a day, you still need to develop other areas of your life - whether that's career, relationships, new business ventures etc - because everyone needs something to fall back on, both financially AND mentally.

I run a small SaaS platform in my spare time, and it generates very little money in the grand scheme of things. But it's mine and I enjoy developing it and getting new customers. If the crypto market was to tank tomorrow, I'd still have this, and that would mean a lot to me. 

Equally, I also have my normal job, and whilst it can be a bit dull at times (and in recent months almost a bit pointless!) it is still something I have continued to strive at, and it's another form of personal development that can open future financial doors.

This is entirely by design. Your exposure to posts on reddit is a function of how many upvotes those posts have received. And the more bagholders a particular coin has, the more upvotes. Which is why the front page is a billboard for ADA, ETH, ALGO, VET, and a handful of others. By definition, the coins you repeatedly see here already have large numbers of holders. You don't get rich buying something that everyone else already owns. Hence why projects start to stagnate when they become popular. Popularity on r/cryptocurrency is actually a great indicator for when growth can be expected to taper. Cardano is perhaps a prime example. 

By contrast, posts about undiscovered projects will almost universally be buried. There may well have been a post shilling SOL at $1 or SHIB in 2020, but they never would have made it past the last page.",2021-11-09 13:47:35

For each $1B in market cap, this data shows how many subscribers each coin has in its respective subreddits. Note that this doesn't include things like stablecoins or outliers like WBTC.

Here we are two years in the future. BTC recovered from a -80% down from its ATH and even after then made another +200%. All that from - 80% to +200% happened in about one year. And today just a year later those FOMO levels are the new Fear levels.

Well fellas... its time to put up or STFU cause that time is today. But judging by things around here I am guessing the modus operandi is going to be more and more whining, this time about how they 'wished' they had sold. And then a couple of weeks or months from now when the market recovers (as it always does) we'll have the same people whining about how they missed that golden opportunity of buying low yet again.. no wonder we have that prophetic joke about buying high and selling low.

**S Tier:**

[Benjamin Cowen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRvqjQPSeaWn-uEx-w0XOIg): Best at Macro and long term Technical Analysis, Always a calm head in this crazy market, his favorite saying is ""what's a few trillions among friends""

[JRNY Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC188KLMYLLGqVJZdYq7mYFw): Best channel for MID cap coins, he consistently made good calls, most coins he shilled went up and stayed up (he doesn't dump on his followers), but even him couldn't help LTC :/

[Coin Bureau](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqK_GSMbpiV8spgD3ZGloSw): Best educational Crypto channel, if I put him in a lower tier this sub will assassinate me (he is also not a financial advisor as he will let you know in literally every video)

[InvestAnswers](https://www.youtube.com/c/InvestAnswers/videos): Added by popular demand, he has a deep understanding of Math and the stock market which he tries to translate into the crypto market

&#x200B;

**A Tier:**

[Digital Assets News](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJgHxpqfhWEEjYH9cLXqhIQ): Had some great calls, this [*Prediction video*](https://youtu.be/zX8Di-gRHWc) is his best and it's aging like fine wine

[Bob Loukas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0zGwzu0zzCImC1BwPuWyXQ): The voice of reason in Crypto, he is good at predicting the start and the end of crypto cycles.

[Finematics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh1ob28ceGdqohUnR7vBACA): If you are in it for the tech this channel is great at making complicated concepts simple.

[Dave Levine](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT4X1qiEPR0gsZYfze6JOyA): If there was such a thing as ETH Maxis association this guy would be the CEO, he is an OG that went through multiple cycles.

[Crazy4crypto](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNHXoNsyoBGVOS0EJarawvw): He was shilling Theta and ZIL before it was cool, he made me a lot of money

[Lark Davis](https://www.youtube.com/user/larksongbird01): I just watch him because he has cool paintings behind him, but he is good too I guess.

[Aantonop](https://www.youtube.com/user/aantonop); One of the OGs of crypto, he is a Bitcoin maxi, but his educational content is great.

**Best Podcasts tier:** [UpOnlytv](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Jt1VYHZO4Kc4cJQP5utdw), [Bankless](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAl9Ld79qaZxp9JzEOwd3aA), [Unchained Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWiiMnsnw5Isc2PP1to9nNw), [What Bitcoin Did](https://www.youtube.com/c/WhatBitcoinDidPodcast/videos), [Millennial Money](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPi6sb9M-Kj-j-PKptcUNJQ)

&#x200B;

**Popular Channels to Avoid Tier:**

[~~Ivan on Tech~~](https://youtube.com/c/IvanonTech) The guy who brought us ""[Respect da pump](https://youtu.be/4TlaEZt6YmQ)"": meme, but his content is terrible

[~~BitBoyCrypto~~](https://youtube.com/channel/UCjemQfjaXAzA-95RKoy9n_g): It's rumored that he dumps his coins on his followers, he promotes risky leverage and his channel content is average at best.

[~~MMCrypto~~](https://youtube.com/c/MMCryptoTube): Same as Bitboy, just empty sensationalism to lure new comers to click on his Bybit affiliate links.

[~~The Moon~~](https://youtube.com/c/TheMoonCarl): His favorite phrase is ""Exaaqctly as predicted"" He buys fake comments to pretend they are making money with his calls so can get more Bybit referrals

&#x200B;

**C, D, E, F, Z Tiers / Red Flags**

As a general rule if someone makes stupid faces in the thumbnails, 100x claims, promotes leveraged trading or Bybit links, you should stay away from him

**Disclaimers:**

DO NOT take any Youtuber's words as gospel, Do your own research, but those are a good start.

If your favorite Youtuber isn't here doesn't mean I hate them, you can add them in the comments

I've seen people dying of hunger in the streets and guess what ? The governments are still strong and standing cause this isn't a fairy tail where the good side always wins.

Double standard cause the US have done far worse than this in literally every war they financed and/or were directly involved with, yet if anyone mentions this they're accused of being Putin apologists.

I can't fathom how cruel some people can get and calling for the hunger of a whole nation because of the actions of their fucked up dictator !

Nevertheless they still hold 46% of the hashrate. Even despite the mining ban. However it has lost the 51% dominance and other countries like the US, Kazakhstan, etc are catching up.

Yes scams will happen always but when the hive mentality ""its only 20/50$"" still exists, crypto will never be taken seriously and adopted at large.

Scams coins aren't gonna stop existing until the demand of them is non existant. And it's not a big amount but if 3.5mil people start using their brains and not their get overwhelmed by their ""where lambo"" mentality things might get a little bit better.

For all new investors, let this be proof that no one knows anything at all concretely, all the time we are seeing ""experts"" and ""analysts"" predicting and being sure of things that are not real.

It is really good to read the news and stay informed, but we must always bear in mind this type of misinformation that affects a large part of investors.

There are still 17 days until the end of the year and all the predictions can happen although now we are in extreme fear and most think that we entered a bear market and that it was ""obvious"" that all this ""was coming"".

Nobody knows anything, if they knew how to anticipate the market all those who are giving ""advice"" would be millionaires and would not be writing nonsense.

It is not the first time that this has happened in the crypto world and it will not be the last, I think it is healthy to keep a memory of these attitudes since they influence much more people who are just starting to invest.

637,"The Ethereum upgrade ""London"" coming in 9 days will be a ""hard fork"" and I found out what that means so you don't have to.",5098,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/osis3a/the_ethereum_upgrade_london_coming_in_9_days_will/,1204,"**What is a Hard Fork?**

A hard fork is when nodes of the newest version of a blockchain no longer accept the older version(s) of the blockchain; which creates a permanent divergence from the previous version of the blockchain.

Adding a new rule to the code essentially creates a fork in the blockchain: one path follows the new, upgraded blockchain, and the other path continues along the old path. Generally, after a short time, those on the old chain will realize that their version of the blockchain is outdated or irrelevant and quickly upgrade to the latest version.

&#x200B;

[Hard Fork Illustration ](https://preview.redd.it/uu6wwcd8rpd71.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=385ef57a88d19ff95fc602860be6433f9d5f02d9)

In a hard fork, holders of tokens in the original blockchain will be granted tokens in the new fork as well, but miners must choose which blockchain to continue verifying.

A hard fork can occur in any blockchain even Bitcoin (where hard forks have created Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV, among several others or Ethereum classic from a previous upgrade)

**""Well if there's a hardfork isn't there also soft fork?"" Yes that's exactly right.**

Hard forks and soft forks are essentially the same in the sense that when a cryptocurrency platform's existing code is changed, an old version remains on the network while the new version is created.

With a soft fork, only one blockchain will remain valid as users adopt the update. Whereas with a hard fork, both the old and new blockchains exist side by side, which means that the software must be updated to work by the new rules. Both forks create a split, but a hard fork creates two blockchains and a soft fork is meant to result in one. 

For example, a block size *decrease* can be implemented by soft-forking. However, doing so doesn’t automatically disconnect you from the network. You still communicate with nodes that aren’t implementing those rules, but you filter out some of the information they pass you.

Edit:  This hardfork requires **no action** for anyone who is holding ETH (Except for node operators). You can keep your Ethereum where it currently is.

The is huge as it signifies market sentiment has completely changed. The S&P was up only 2.22% today on news of the fed hike, and since 4 is bigger than 2, I feel confident in saying we have officially decoupled from the stock market. 

I know what you’re thinking- “4% in a day isn’t that big of a change.” And yes, I agree with you, but let’s imagine the market grows 4% everyday for the next year. Because crypto is a 24/7 market, we get 2 days over the stock market. 4% of compounding interest over 365 means $100 investment today could turn into $164,880,329 a year from today. Now that’s wife-changing money!

Why do I think this? Well, the fed stated will continue to increase rates over the next year. From that, I can deduce the market will increase at the same rate over the next year. 

I can’t believe yesterday my wife was telling I was an idiot for losing half of our child’s college money on “magic internet money.” After I tell her that I’ve only lost 40% of the money, she’ll really be eating crow.

For context this is the account of Mr. White Hat. The vulnerability in question could have allowed the white hat hacker to change the order prices of cryptocureencies listed on Coinbase (think he can out any price for any crypto he wants and buy or sell BTC ETH at any price he wants). Not wouldn't have affected just Coinbase. Many DeFi projects also use Coinbase as a price oracle... so something like this happening could have triggered an extinction event to all crypto markets, possibly liquidating tens of billions, maybe a hundred billion dollars.

Mr. White hat wasn't joking when he said this was potentiallytially market nuking. The person who fixed optimism critical vulnerability was awarded with a $2 million bounty. No matter where you stand, this vulnerability was much bigger and it's impact could have been massive. 

Coinbase being Coinbase, deemed fit to reward our hacker with $250k, and there wasn't even any epic item to go with it. 3/10 would not do this quest again lmao.

This also shows a classic human behavior. You'd skim on $50 worth of protection all the time but when you suddenly smash your head on the pavement and be bed ridden for the rest of your life you're gonna wish you didn't forget your protective gear. But of course you only appreciate your protective gear when you're bed ridden. When nothing happens you think even $50 is too expensive, maybe you could haggle it down to $9.69.

Especially during COVID-19",4986,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ly79uw/as_an_iranian_crypto_has_changed_the_life_of/,511,"Seeing the post about Iran officially considering mining Bitcoin, I felt motivated to make this post as an Iranian. Cryptocurrency has changed the dynamics in Iran. The Iranian government's view on it has been quite lax compared to neighboring countries or other Muslim countries. There was either support for it or it was simply ignored since you couldn't really spend it on anything. On top of that, given the fact that Iran is disconnected from international banking, there was less concern from Iranian banks. (A bit ignorant, but I am not complaining)

But things have changed drastically over the past few years. The increased sanctions and COVID have brought a lot more people towards crypto, including me. Crypto has a very unique situation in Iran, which I will try to explain briefly. The Iranian currency is currently the cheapest in the world (or one of the cheapest, as its unstable and can change daily). So if someone can earn dollars and spend it in Iran, they are going to profit a lot. We are talking close to 25x increase. This makes mining insanely profitable. Because you are going to pay for your electricity in Iranian currency, but you are earning dollars, because crypto exchange rate is based on western currencies, not Iranian. So electricity is dirt cheap to begin with, but you can get it even cheaper.

There are ways to get free electricity in Iran. The government subsidizes businesses that have high electricity usage, so they get publicly funded electricity. So the owner of these businesses makes deals with individuals to buy hardware needed to mine currency (because the initial cost is very high due to currency difference), and usually one person with contacts overseas becomes the ""broker"" to be able to turn these cryptos into tangible money.  People without these businesses tend to form mining communities where they work together to discreetly mine and turn crypto into actual currency and due to the fact that a lot of people are dealing in crypto now, you can actually find a lot of buyers locally, and don't even need to sell it to foreigners.

So, this way crypto got introduced into society and a lot of people use it. Usually not as an investment, but as a currency you use to spend on things. Because in order to make an international purchase, you need to abuse a lot of loopholes, such as VPNs, middlemen and exchange rates. But now I can simply buy steam gift cards with bitcoin and use them to buy games. This applies to any international purchase. 60$ games used to cost a fortune, like an entire minimum wage income in Iran. Now they are widely available if you have crypto.

The usual mishandling of the Iranian government in regards to the economy is bad enough, but in recent years sanctions and COVID have made it a three way hell. My life personally was hell because I could not make any international purchase and I could barely make ends meet. Crypto is so empowering. I am basically able to earn and spend money despite the efforts of both Iranian and American governments. In order to put things in perspective, I can use myself as an example. I am a lawyer and I earn more money from mining that I do practicing law. I am still working, but crypto is a great secondary income which I can use to make international purchases without having to pay half of my income for a 100$ purchase. We are still in bad conditions, but crypto provides a lifeline. At least for now.

I am grateful for cryptocurrency and this community, because the livelihood of many people in Iran relies on crypto and information about it. Most people involved in crypto trade in Iran don't even speak English, but know that an entire country is thankful for it, and the value of crypto could not be clearer. An entire people neglected by their own government and sanctioned by half the world, left to basically starve and live in terrible conditions, continue to go on. In large part, thanks to crypto currencies. We practically have the power to defy the strongest governments in the world, the next step is THE MOON.

One [address](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x116311805390458bb65b2954290c2eb8c944e41d) has made three executive transactions (telling the multisig what to do), withdrawing a few MATIC at a time. This was likely a test to see if the multisig operated as intended.

Seeing as this address is likely earning the royalties, and owns so many of the Trump Cards, this is almost certainly someone in Trump's organization.

To me it seems as though this multisig will sweep all of the cheap/floor price cards and then dump them all after they hit a specific price. Any regular person would sell at least a few when the price pumps, especially if they have a giant amount like 1k.

For those who are out of the loop, a moonshot is something that has a low probability of becoming extremely successful \[1\].

While it’s definitely nice to be the guy who made the correct play, what I wanted to understand is, how likely are you to pick the next big coin? After all, there are more than [2,400 dead coins](https://www.coinopsy.com/dead-coins/#other) that were part of someone’s moonshot not that long back. When a coin is dead, we would end up losing almost 100% of the capital that we invested in it thereby breaking the cardinal rule of investing.

>*Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1 -* ***Warren Buffet***

While Warren Buffet might not be the best example for the crypto world, his advice holds true just as well in all investing spaces - Once you lose your capital, it’s game over. So in this deep-dive, let's see how the less popular cryptos have performed over the years, whether it makes sense to invest in them, and finally, would you have made better returns just by investing in the top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum?!

### Data & Analysis Methodology

All the data used in the analysis has been collected from coinmarketcap.com. Their data is available going as far back as 2014. I collected the price, market cap, and the symbol for all the coins listed in coinmarketcap on Jan 1st of every year from 2014 to 2022. There were only 67 listed coins in 2014. The list has grown to more than 3,000+ as of Jan 2022. All the data and my analysis are shared as a Rows sheet at the end.

The analysis is fairly simple and I have intentionally made the strategy straightforward so that it’s easy to replicate. We will be comparing the performance of the Top 10 Cryptocurrencies with the next 90 based on the total market cap of the coin.

[The end of 2017 was definitely some wild time to be in the Crypto space.](https://preview.redd.it/ie9owd9mylv81.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=706c591e7d231facdee94ad62a74d3dd63a3057a)

I have limited the analysis to the top 100 coins because of two reasons

1. Even now, close to 95% of the combined market cap of the crypto market is contributed by just the top 100 coins. Adding to this, it becomes more and more difficult/riskier \[2\] to invest in coins having low market cap due to platform and liquidity issues.
2. There are hundreds of new coins that are being launched every day. It’s almost impossible to keep track of all the coins and realistically do proper due diligence before investing. So for practical feasibility, I am limiting it to the top 100.

### Results

Before we jump straight into the return calculation, it’s interesting to see how the crypto market has changed over the years.

https://preview.redd.it/m0fng8moylv81.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6ebef942f0bb3e570ec51568a223ebaa1c5c714f

In the first few years where crypto was becoming mainstream (2014 to 2017), the top 10 currencies dominated the overall market cap contributing close to 99% \[3\]. Also, during crashes, we can observe a massive shift in capital allocation from Altcoin to Bitcoin → 2017 was one of the best bull runs (barring 2021) where we can see that Bitcoin only contributed to \~39% of the market cap. But once the bear market set in (2018-19), the allocation to bitcoin proportionally increased until the 2021 bull run.

#### Creating a Crypto Index

To answer our initial question → Whether it’s better to invest in the top 10 most popular cryptos or the other 90 relatively lesser-known ones, we will be creating an equal-weighted index \[4\].

We have two people Alan and Charlie who want to get into the crypto market in 2014, but both are following a slightly different approach.

Alan will invest only in the top 10 most popular currencies. Every new year, he will go and check the top 10 cryptos by Market Cap and then equally invest between the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Charlie, on the other hand, will do the exact same thing with the only difference being that instead of the top 10, he will invest in the 90 next biggest cryptocurrencies.

They continue to do this over the next 8 years and now it’s 2022 and it’s time to see who has performed better.

[Returns shown here are till Jan 1st, 2022](https://preview.redd.it/5u10wctsylv81.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ccd4df269ea3a81904e54ab5d06210039e50edf4)

Would you look at that! Alan who has invested in only the top-10 cryptos did vastly better than Charlie who went for the riskier play of investing in the not so well known currencies. The top 10 cryptos on average performed 5x better than the next 90 and 2x better than just investing in Bitcoin. What’s even more interesting is that Charlie would have done 2x better just putting his money in Bitcoin - Ouch!

#### Survival

If you are wondering why Charlie is getting the lowest return in spite of taking the most risk\[5\], it’s because you are forgetting Rule 1 of investing - To not lose your initial investment.

https://preview.redd.it/mmntwr9vylv81.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0dbb77cb2a0125748ac26c763d91adc35eefdcde

The probability of survival of a coin is extremely skewed towards the top 10 currencies. As you can see, over 80% of the top 10 coins from 2014 are still in existence today compared to only 26% of the rest. This trend keeps repeating over the years and your capital would have been decimated. Once it goes to zero, there is no way for it to come back up as any gain on $0 is still 0!

#### Moonshots

Finally, we come to what we are all here for! What are our chances of actually hitting a moonshot following this strategy?

[I have defined a 100x return as a Moonshot](https://preview.redd.it/j8oiifewylv81.png?width=404&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4f8fb526dc71aa2efca0c1fea03c5e983eff3ee8)

Well, your chances of hitting a moonshot are also much higher following the top-10 strategy. Overall, you had a 1 in 10 chance of getting a 10,000% return compared to the 1 in 30 chance of the riskier next-90 strategy.

The above chart also shows another interesting stat → Out of the 500+ cryptos that we analyzed, less than 4% of them ended up becoming a moonshot. Think about that for a min - Of all the cryptos you are likely to hear about (*as there is very less coverage if it’s not in the top 100*), only 3-4% of them end up giving you those insane returns. You have similar chances betting on a single number on the Roulette wheel.

https://preview.redd.it/23hva9qyylv81.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5af162b36f5bd910f11d4c6761bced864a22823d

As you can see, of all our moonshots, Ethereum investment in 2016 ended up returning the most at a whopping 397,548%!

### Limitations

It’s important to understand the limitations of the current analysis before trying to replicate it.

1. **Data** \- As I discussed earlier, all the data is from coinmarketcap and I have assumed a coin is dead if it’s not listed in the following year’s data. This analysis is only as strong as the quality of input data \[6\]. I have done extensive QCs but feel free to play around with the raw data to see if I missed something.
2. **Base Effect** \- The market is considerably different now than it was in 2015-17. There is more awareness as well as penetration. So the future growth might not be as explosive as the one that we observed in the past decade, so you should be realistic about your return potential
3. **Intra Year Returns** \- The current analysis only considers returns based on Jan 1st of every year starting from 2014. If we pick another date within the year, we might get slightly different results as there might have been ATHs and ATLs within the year which we are not capturing.

### Conclusion

>*It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong — George Soros*

I started the analysis thinking that investing in the not-so-popular currencies is bound to give better returns as it’s more likely they are undervalued due to lower publicity and hype associated with them.

But, as we saw from the data, in the case of crypto it’s much more profitable just to invest in the top currencies. It’s like the case where being in the game is much more important than trying to hit it big and striking out!

I was going to reply in a comment, but I feel that a lot of people can benefit from a short write-up on them.

#What is a sell wall?

A sell wall is a tool used by a rich individual,or group of rich individuals, to manipulate the price of a stock downwards. A large sell order is set at a specific price by the whale(s) to prevent higher sell orders from executing.

A sell wall looks like this on the depth chart: http://brettwestbrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-12.58.10-PM.png

###How does it work?

This is best explained as an example.

A wealthy person, we will call him Richard, tells a group of his wealthy friends that he wants to make money on a particular stock. This could be for a number of reasons such as:

* The stock has a lot of room to grow
* The stock can be easily manipulated
* The stock has a lot of potential to get big in the near future

Richard and his friends decide that it's a good idea. They all want 1 million of X cryptocurrency. *Unfortunately, in the cryptocurrency market Richard and his friends can't execute all the buy orders at once or the prices will skyrocket!* 


To achieve 1 million obtained goal, they decide to set up a sell wall, and manipulate the price downwards. They do this in steps:

1. They accumulate together. They will maybe get 250,000 of X crypto each. In their specific market, this didn't affect the price that much. Great! 

2. They now set a specific price they feel is low enough for them to be able to reach their 1m X crypto goal. For this particular crypto they decide to all sell their obtained crypto at $2.40.

3. Now, between Richard and the group, there is >1 million dollars worth of X crypto selling for @2.40 on the market, a seemingly undervalued price.There is SO much volume being sold now, buying pressure cannot eat through that wall in a reasonable time frame - it would take a very high buying pressure to do so. 

What also happens next is the key: nobody else can sell above that sell wall price until it's gone. The result? People need to sell lower than the sell wall in order to liquefy their stock. This drives the price downwards.

Richard and his friends can now safey all get to their 1m X crypto mark without raising the price exponentially! When they decide to rid their sell walls the price moves up accordingly!

##How can you use this to your advantage?

A common thought is that the main goal of a sell wall is to instill fear into the weaker hands so that they sell by the thought that ""Oh no everyone is selling!!"" While it's not the main purpose, it probably does happen a little bit. People get nervous when things a large volume of crypto is being sold.

As Warren Buffet said: *Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful.*

For a real life example:

VECHAIN. 

For those that don't know, about a month ago vechain was sitting around 29 cents. They had a pretty large announcement that was, yes, front page of reddit. The price nearly doubled to 70 cents (it actually happened right before the announcement). 

What happened after? Some people bought the rumor and sold the news. But, this news was really big. Masternodes, rebranding, big partnerships. Ask any VEN holder why the price didn't continue to rise after that and they will probably know why - price manipulation with sell walls.

Such as: https://i.redd.it/bjaubsgn04601.png

VECHAIN has had a lot of new partnerships, announcements, and generally great news to propel the crypto further, but has been held back by these sells walls constantly. Just recently buying pressure has been very high and the whales have been having trouble controlling it they way they would like.

That's a real example of what has been happening. Take a look at roadmaps and see where different projects are at in development. Are any projects getting seemingly great news without moving in price?

What about REQ? We saw a couple of front page posts about REQ moving to main net, quality pictures from the UI, etc etc. REQ was fairly stagnant around 30 cents before slingshotting to 80 cents in nearly a day. Sell walls and price manipulation.This field is speculative so any news drives buying pressure. Unfortunately, the very wealthy have a say as well. 

Look for great projects and determine if they solve a need. Look to see what's hitting the media's spot light, such as the front page here. **THEN take a look at the depth charts on the exchanges.** In crypto anything goes, and you better believe the very wealthy have difficult to obtain knowledge. When you see these obvious sell walls, you want to investigate and try to identify any trends. 

Perhaps you can look at **volume** of a cryptocurrency. A stagnant crypto with LOTS of volume is a huge indicator, sideways consolidation. Ripple did this for a few weeks, even months at certain stages. 

Once you find one that looks good - **you'll need to hold at the mercy of the whales.** Trust me, they want profit more than you do. The wait is almost always worth it because price will rise very rapidly once selling pressure is completely abolished.


Hope this helps guys.

\*\*\*Edit \*\*\*

TLDR summary

&#x200B;

The crux is they don't spend money on It and make money in doing so.

&#x200B;

Ask the exchange(s):

While they may say ""we dont make money indirectly off insurance funds"" they absolutely do.

its your right as an investor to have this detail You have every right to know the details of an insurance fund you are paying into.

Since everyone accepts that a lot of exchanges do this, other exchanges do it to. I literally have screenshots of conversations that say this much.

You are being throttled out. They can indeed scale up at a cost.

If for some reason they can not they have a fiduciary duty the moment they take your funds to tell you the risk of their incapable IT architecture and settings. Moreover, they could just install a kill switch that ends trades without penalty if the web servers go down or they exceed band width.

As cost-effective as it is to build in a kill switch as a solution its not profitable to exchanges that are having a liquidity crisis. Assets on exchanges are becoming more scarce. (reference IEP 1559 and many other facets)

If an exchange restricts your access they should still not be placing higher priority orders via the OTC desk while you are locked out. This should also be disclosed.

While they may say we dont make money indirectly off insurance funds they absolutely do.

Cloudflare is the brand of edge network they are using as a server to facilitate HSTS protocol controls to throttle down access to their whim.  I didn't want to get so deep as to dive into protocol-level details in this post as I was speaking to a very broad audience.

and

Cloudflare Error 1015: “You are being rated limited” results from one of a few possible causes.

Most frequently, when a legitimate site visitor is being blocked by the rate-limiting error 1015 it’s due to issues with the rate-limiting configuration that only the site owner can fix.

With rate limiting, Cloudflare can automatically block traffic from a suspicious site visitor or IP address so that hackers, spammers, and other online pests are can’t bog down your site’s performance with DDoS attacks and other illicit activities.

This is only one small part of a larger need to a very complex and detailed situation.

I hope this helps

Hey all,

&#x200B;

I used to design data centers ( I became a full time crypto trader) and I got very concerned when i saw them using tech i am very familiar with to try and steal peoples money via liquidations.

Trading leverage is risky but to for a company to game the system with thier data center design is just not ok.

&#x200B;

below is a screen shot of Kucoin denying access to the website on peak times using Cloudflare.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q52vibbgk9v71.jpg?width=1346&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=608f498ff860f7c489b6efa7544f3a871b57c627

Cloudflare is used for 2 purposes. To stop a DDOS attack ( millions of bots refreshing a web browser to crash a server) and to defer traffic to redundant servers when server loads peak.

Essentially they are treating all their customers like a DDOS attack and saving money on not having a redundant webserver at AWS ( Amazon Data centers).

&#x200B;

If I was wrong I figure someone would at least talk to me about it.

but when i add this server denail access stuff on top of little nuansces like them removing the liquidation price on margin to increase customer risk I got more concerned.

&#x200B;

Their servers are going down way too often as well [https://downdetector.com/status/kucoin/archive/](https://downdetector.com/status/kucoin/archive/)

Essentially by not spending more on IT they make more money.

When the servers go down they are still processing institutional orders via the OTC desk

The link below is not spam its to the Cloudflare's website ( kucoins vendor)

[https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/)

They are treating their own customer base as a threatening attack like DDOS

Kucoin is assigned a Cloudflare Ray ID, an identifier like a phone #. Kucoin ray id 69fc3e2db9e762eB

Kucoin uses Amazon Data centers or AWS, they could recitify this whole issue by using geo load balancers aka a gateway load balancer

[https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/aws-gateway-load-balancer-is-now-available-in-additional-9-regions/](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/aws-gateway-load-balancer-is-now-available-in-additional-9-regions/)

Instead they let the servers go down and get laggie to make extra money. They save money on IT and make money off liquidations

Roughly 5% of their revenue comes from liquidations.

Helpdesk wont even acknowledge this; I designed data centers, I know how this works for anyone who has questions

I posted this on the Kucoin subreddit and ""no surprise"" I was banned.

It legitimizes what I am saying as if I was wrong their help desk could have asked me for my support ticket

I was in error, the mod list goes private when you are banned. I feel its important for me to correct inaccuracies

How else do they know ( they are knowingly doing this)

&#x200B;

How this works is Amazon data centers charges you by the cumulative resources you consume. ( cpu, gpu, data storage, ram etc)

In these settings you can throttle the virtual machine/ cloud servers resources forcing it to go down. I am not implying that they are doing this.

I am saying they are knowingly using settings that let the server go down repeatedly. There are formulas to calculate loads on concurrent users. They are clearly not using settings or intentionally using settings that trip the server to go down.

If you dig through this archive you can see when outages are being reported. They get a system notice that they hit a threshold of resource utilization.

[https://downdetector.com/status/kucoin/archive/](https://downdetector.com/status/kucoin/archive/)

Now in the event, you have a crazy anomaly Cloudflare and Amazon have the ability to redirect to a redundant location with a technology called geo load balancing

[https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/aws-gateway-load-balancer-is-now-available-in-additional-9-regions/](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/aws-gateway-load-balancer-is-now-available-in-additional-9-regions/)

Notice in my screenshot that it says there is a gateway issue

that link talks about load balancing the gateway ( offloading the processing power)

They VERY MUCH KNOW THEY ARE DOING THIS

&#x200B;

Infact I let the CEO know via PM

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Essentially thier help desk team does nothing and they keep passing you back and forth until you give up.

In professional management the term for this is ""being managed out""

&#x200B;

\*\*I share these communications just to show THEY DAMN WELL KNOW AND NEVER DISPUTE WHAT I SAY\*\*\*\*

They are getting system notices  via email from amazon (e.g. You are at 89% cpu utilization you need to scale or you may face faliure)

Their Amazon (AWS) sales guy is calling them every day trying to sell them more services.

&#x200B;

e.g. Hey i am your hypothetical Amazon Sales Guy "" I noticed you guys are throttling cpu load on webservers, can I offer you a bigger package and maybe we should tal;k about fail over locations incase your server goes down under load.

&#x200B;

frankly, I would bet my life on it that they know this is an issue and why

&#x200B;

There isnt a data center architect  (what I did) on the planet that couldn't answer why their servers are going down.  This is 101 level stuff

&#x200B;

They also have the ability to kill the back end server ( where trades happen) this is done on all major exchanges  like the HK ex

[https://www.hkex.com.hk/News/Market-Communications/2016/160425news?sc\_lang=en](https://www.hkex.com.hk/News/Market-Communications/2016/160425news?sc_lang=en)

&#x200B;

Essentially the webserver sends a hearth beat signal  ( its literally called that) if the heartbeat is not heard all trades pause ( a kill switch)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat\_(computing)#:\~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20heartbeat,parts%20of%20a%20computer%20system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_(computing)#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20heartbeat,parts%20of%20a%20computer%20system).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is VERY common design work, like windows to a house level ... for lack of better comparrison

In Kucoins instance they let the webserver go down but the back end server was still moving. All the whales use OTC desks and have dedicated access. So they processed the whale orders and let all of us burn alive and took our money

Its safe to say they have ZERO plausible deniability

&#x200B;

I can share screen shots with thier help desk if its hellp ful

Should they not comment or address the issue, I will have all the answers I need.

If they do show up we have a chance to ask questions.

If they have nothing to hide, they won't be hiding.

There are people asking if this is possible an honest IT mistake. Like they messed up and don't know any better

Well I hope not

Would you run a business solely on the web that handles over $1 billion dollars of transactions daily without a single redundancy fail-over site for high availability which is a ubiquitous industry standard?

If you had issues with web server outages more than all of your competitors and relied on transaction fees for income... there would be an obvious question of ""doesn't downtime hurt your income from transaction fees if your customer cant process transactions?

If they are honest... they are so grossly incompetent they are still just as big of a threat.

Occam's razor is **a principle of theory construction or evaluation** according to which, other things equal, explanations that posit fewer entities, or fewer kinds of entities, are to be preferred to explanations that posit more.

So what is more plausible is"" a company rose to #3 by market cap and is processing over 1 billion a day in transactions but yet never heard of the industry-standard redundancies.

They cant figure out how to stop the loss of income from amissing transaction fees

They also never address that they have more outages during periods of high liquidity transfer ( not volume) than all of their competitors.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yet still, appease their institutional customers moving $35 million in assets or more?

or

&#x200B;

That they are pulling an industry-standard broker tactic of pulling out the proverbial buy/ sell button of securities when they may have a liquidity crisis. \* Like Robinhood did with GMC, AMC, and Dogecoin. While still catering to whales

&#x200B;

I hope they show up to answer these questions.

Because of the derivative funding fees, the constant issues with withdrawals (often you can't withdraw), deleting stop losses, not triggering stop losses and removing the liquidation price  on margin contracts increasing the risk of liquidation makes me want to ask a lot of questions

&#x200B;

When I started to ask these questions I got instantly banned.

&#x200B;

When I looked up there moderators and saw they were teh executives of the comapny and tagged them, they made the mod list private.

&#x200B;

Through this all, I am still willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, but your don't get to lock me out of my house and then burn it to the ground.. subsequently blame me for it.

They tried to silence me when I asked questions.

There is something off here!

Congratulation to all ETH holders who have held it through the consolidation of long and hurtful months. It sucks when you see other coins pumping but ETH stays where it is, but nothing hurts more than selling the coins you believe in to chase the coins that are pumping just to miss the pump of the coins you believe in. (been there done that)

Let's celebrate today and hope ETH can find footing above the previous ATH. To infinity and beyond!!",2021-11-08 01:09:17

It is horrible for me to see them rise to power again today.

My family is still in Kabul. I can tell you that cryptocurrencies would not have saved them. As soon as other countries heard of the Taliban rising, they closed all embassies so nobody could get a visa. It used to be easy to get out of the country to atleast Pakistan, India or China but they too closed their borders when the Taliban march became too 'real'. With no passports, no visums and no money for 90% of the Afghan people, where would they go?

As more and more provinces were being taken, more and more people were forced to go to Kabul. Most of these fugitives had fought against the taliban in their own province and were now forced to sleep in the parks, on the ground and in the parkings lots. The locals of Kabul spared them whatever food they could.......

When the Taliban circled Kabul, hyperinflation occured. Prices of all foods skyrocketed out of fear of dying of starvation. Do you really believe cryptocurrencies could have changed this?

**I think not.**

Also what many people don't realise is that many in Afghanistan are UNBANKED. They only hold some cash and use it to buy stuff. Cash would be more useful in this scenario than having cryptocurrencies on some exchange or even in your wallet. What if they turn off the internet? They will surely censor a large part of the internet if not compeletly turn it off. I remember back in 2000, you weren't even allowed to listen to music, hold a wedding etc. I fear for my family but all I can do is pray.

Like the title says, I ""gave"" each of my dogs $100 to invest in crypto and plan on giving them the rewards (probably in the form of special treats, food, toys) when they reach the appropriate age.

For practical reasons I did not create accounts for them in an exchange, we will be using my account instead and I will be managing their funds for the time being. Just imagining how long the verification (kyc) process would take for them gave me a headache. Moreover, my dogs are still not very good using the keyboard or touchscreens, so it made more sense for me to do it.

Even though I am technically managing the funds for them, they were actually the ones who decided which projects were worth investing in. In order to save time I decided it would be best to show them the logo of each crypto and read them the name, if they barked, that meant they wanted me to buy some. I decided to allocate their $100 in three equal parts among the first 3 projects they barked at. This way they would have a diverse portfolio.

The results were the following:

* Gandalf the Beagle (DOGE, CAKE, SHIBA)
* Attila the Pug (DOGE, BAT, ADA)

Like I said, the decision was theirs, I have to respect it. Gandalf was probably just hungry at the moment and thought I was offering him cake and the sight of a doge and shiba dogs made him happy. Attila probably chose doge for the same reason, and I guess he reacted at the word ""bat"" because he hates bats. At first I was surprised when he chose ADA. I thought he had probably been reading up on the project and read about the smart contracts being implemented today. Now I just thing he though I said ""ADA BOYYY"".

I will let you know how these investments turn out, remember it's important to think about your pets' financial future as well.

Recently, I made a trade and sold off some crypto to keep some funds in USD for a move down I anticipated happening.  Everything was going according to plan and the next morning I got up to make my trade, only to find more than $1000 was missing from my USD funds.

&#x200B;

[The $11 buy was with separate money](https://preview.redd.it/ikvei79uho871.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdb7a73aebf9c8f9d99d08c7ee3eb8b3a0d2f495)

Confused, I tried to reach out to [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) to no avail.  I did some research and found out people have been waiting months for tickets to be resolved.  That was unacceptable to me, so I filed formal complaints with the BBB and the SEC, of which both cases are still open at the time of this writing.

Today, [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) emailed me back and notified me they removed $1000 from my trade because ""their records"" show a deposit I made on the 25th of June never went through.  

&#x200B;

[This is the first indication I got of where the money went](https://preview.redd.it/x4y4wdp8jo871.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f94935728d624b64c5456677d638fdcfe13320b)

Confused, I logged into my bank account to check my account and sure enough, there was a transaction for $1000 on June 25th.

[Bank Statement](https://preview.redd.it/b7r6h0fkjo871.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3c42ed146079c84c70640419107325757db1a1d)

The most alarming thing about this is that [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) gave me ZERO indication that they were doing this, and if I wasn't the type of person who pays very close attention to his account, that money would have been gone forever with me being none the wiser.  There were no emails, no alerts, nothing on my account, zilch, to indicate what they did.  And to top it all off, it was done in the middle of the night, somewhere between 3-4am PST, as the market was falling.  So when I woke up, the PNL looked as if it was a normal red day.  To top it all off, they took MORE than $1000 when they removed the money from my account.

If you guys are using [Binance.US](https://Binance.US), get your money off of that exchange ASAP and watch your funds like a hawk.  There will likely be a lawsuit that stems from these types of practices, and it shows that [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) is being grossly incompetent with people's money to the point of negligence.  Please do not use them and use this message to protect yourself.


UPDATE: Binance.US is doubling down and saying they never received the funds.  I called my bank and they confirmed the transaction did go through in a timely manner.  

I traced out my bank statement with my USD deposits on Binance.US and they match up perfectly, minus the $1000 + a few extra they took without telling me.",2021-07-01 22:57:28

Let’s start with reddit and MOONS. I know at the moment even though the amount of moons per karma has decreased incredibly it’s still such an amazing concept to get your head around. Rewarding the user with tokens that could potentially earn the users money just for providing good content is extraordinary. This seems like a good step in the right direction instead of things like likes on Instagram where their only value is self esteem. In addition, it’s not focused on appearance so it’s a lot less biased; anyone with a good thing to say will be upvoted no matter what they look like. 

Next is brave and BATS. I understand that if brave went mainstream then they would earn a ridiculous amount of money through advertisement but this would also then be split with the person that’s getting the advertisement shoved down their throat. I know I would personally prefer to get payed for being manipulated by ads then just be manipulated for free. Not to mention the other benefits brave has to offer.

If you go onto the XRP/USDT pairing on LAToken and scroll back to the 23rd February you can see the price dropped to 0.00004USDT per XRP. I had placed very low limit orders prior to this that have since been filled.

When I logged into my account after placing these low bids on the market a while back, I was amazed to see I had amassed 632,151 XRP tokens.

Here’s the heart-breaking bit. I naturally was mind-blown, so I tried to sell some of the XRP in the account then withdraw my profits from the exchange elsewhere, only to have the withdrawal declined and my account temporarily closed for 1 day siting a ‘violation of our terms of use’. I have done nothing wrong and simply set low limit orders that were filled.

I contacted support asking why this has happened, they didn’t tell me why my account was restricted or what terms of use I had broken. After the 24 hours my account is back up, all the XRP is gone and I’m left with the cryptocurrency I had originally. I contact support again asking for my coins back, I get vague responses not related to the issue.

Dip is 10-20% down. Don't buy it.

When it happens, Redditors will jump on you screaming *BUY THE DIP* directly to your ear. Don't buy it. You're calm, your mind is clear, you aren't fueled by emotions.

Soon it will dip 20-30%. You will notice frequent memes like

>What I thought was the dip. The dip. The actual dip. The actual dips dip.

Logically, you still don't take the bait. You play the waiting game. You are in charge here.

Next leg is minus 30-40%. Some people are borrowing money to buy here, since they spent all of their money on previous dips. Some people start questioning is this just a correction or bearmarket. You will notice posts like

>When Bitcoin was 60k you wished you bought it at 40k. Now it's below 40k buy now as you promissed!

You just smirk reading this post, take a sip of your tea, scroll down, turn on radio or something.

Next leg is minus 40-60% from ATH. Alts are massacred. You will notice that no one will even mention buying the dip, even as a joke. Even people who bought the dips are now down so much, that their stress is somehow even as the literal top buyers. People are now posting predictions of low will it go.

At this point, you start stretching. Counting your money. Calculating how much can you afford to spend on crypto. Getting prepared for the last stage.

**60-80% correction, bearmarket acceptance and capitulation phase**

Suicide hotline number is posted, and pinned by moderators. Divorce rates increase. People are selling for a loss, because they are emotionally damaged and don't want to play this game anymore. Others are just deleting apps related to crypto on their phones. Moonboys are out. Newbies are out. Sub is pretty much dead, low number of comments and posts. There isn't hope on a horizon.

This is where you start buying. You also accumulate every now or then when you can afford. You do this for next two years or whenever next rally starts. Here's how to recognize when to exit, also know as top signals:

Apparently the devs didn't sell any coins, which I don't really believe. What's worse, I could've sold for a nice 2x profit, but I believed in the project and bought the dip.

The warning signs were kind of there, the audit had some things that in hindsight, were kind of dodgy. Don't even know why I'm writing this, I can survive without the money, but it is a real freacking kick in the gut...

720,"We all know ETH fees are high. Here's why it's happening, how to save money, and what is being done about it going forward.",4744,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lcshic/we_all_know_eth_fees_are_high_heres_why_its/,619,"Full disclaimer: I own some ETH. I've seen a lot of posts here and in /r/ethereum talking about high fees. I've also seen a lot of extremely misleading statements here and there about how high fees are right now and will try and simplify things a bit. I'll do my best to remain impartial, and feel free to correct me and I'll edit my post. All plans are subject to change, the following is based on my current understanding and recollection of developer statements.

>What is happening?

* ETH fees are high right now. The best place to see gas costs (how much you'll need to pay for a transaction vs how quickly you want it) is here: https://ethgasstation.info/

* Smart contracts and ERC-20 tokens consume much more gas than a basic transfer. While a typical transfer might be $3 a poorly written smart contract could consume $100 in gas. This variation leads to lots of confusion on various forums. An absolute metric crap ton of tokens run on ETH, so ETH being congested causes lots of downstream effects, tokens that consume lots of gas are disproportionately effected.

>Why is this happening?

 * [Utilization is through the roof right now](https://txstreet.com/v/eth-btc). At post time ETH is achieving 16.14 TPS vs BTC's 4.00. Despite being 4 times faster the demand for on-chain (L1) transactions is overwhelming. At the bottom of [this page, make sure to scroll down](https://ethgasstation.info/index.php) you can see that blocks are at 100% right now. That means people are constantly outbidding each other to make it in.

 * At post time [Uniswap](https://ethgasstation.info/gasguzzlers.php) is the biggest gas guzzler. People are using Decentralized Exchanges (dex'es) a ton and its consuming a huge chunk of block space and people are paying a premium for it.

>How can I save money?

 * ETH demand fluctuates heavily throughout the day, it's not uncommon for fees to drop 10x in an hour. If you are not in a hurry waiting a bit for a slow period and broadcasting a median gas transaction can save you a TON of money

 * Some wallets/apps are designed to be super user friendly, and unfortunately they hardcode the fastest possible gas costs for a good user experience (UX). Unfortunately that's a very bad idea when gas is high and only causes rates to climb even more. EIP-1559 will fix this, more on that later

 * Don't interact with smart contracts if you don't have to. It sucks, I know. But the fact is that using a smart contract is way more expensive than normal transactions. When gas is a fraction of a penny nobody cares, but its not right now and this is where we are. Last I checked, L1 [ETH](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee) transfers are still cheaper than [BTC](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee). Not much of a consolation, but it's not a *total* disaster yet. EDIT: It appears the last 2 days ETH has flipped BTC on transaction costs. $17 USD still seems really really high, as of post-time a $5 transaction would go through within a few minutes)

>What is being done about this? (sorted by est delivery date)

 * Berlin upgrade: Est 1-2 months, will adjust gas costs of various transactions for certain core operations. Should help fees overall on many contracts.

 * EIP-1559: Est ""this summer, but maybe Q3"": A huge overhaul to the fee system. Block sizes are FLEXIBLE, targeting 50% full. When a block exceeds 50% full the base fee increases. When it drops below 50% the base fee decreases. Fees are burned (nice deflationary side effect). This means a few things: A) Spikes in transactions can make the next block instead of clogging the mem pool B) costs are MUCH more easy to calculate, and block include time estimation is much easier. C) The improved predictability/include time means shitty apps won't have a reason to set absurd fees for a good UX, driving ""gas inflation"" like we see now. There's a lot more to EIP-1559, but that's the gist of how it should impact transactions

 * 2.0 Phase 0: Already live, but the beacon chain won't impact 1.0 until ""the merge"". Baseline TPS should be higher than 1.0, and its also environmentally friendly :)

 * 2.0 Phase 1: Est end of 2021, Sharding will first scale to 64 shards (eventually 1024) for a 64x scaling effect on the beacon chain. 

 * The Merge: Some call this Phase 1.5, but it is planned for 2022. This will move ETH 1.0 as a shard on to 2.0, and all finality will occur on the beacon chain. At this point ETH's core TPS should be 64-100x faster than what we have today

 * 2.0 Phase 2: Est end of 2022/2023, Execution Environments aka sharded smart contracts allow for smart contracts to share data across shards so that DeFi/Dex'es etc benefit from 2.0's massive scalability

>What other out-of-order improvements are coming?

 * Various L2 technologies are already live, and several smart contracts are upgrading to them now. This will let you pay on L1 to ""get in"", then perform a lot of cheap transactions on L2. Right now every trade on uniswap clogs L1. When it runs on L2 all those trades are off-chain and gas fees are only driven up by deposits/withdrawals. This should have a massive impact on overall gas costs. The good news is the insane fees on some contracts act as an INCENTIVE to get L2 up and running faster.

I know a lot of people are unhappy with the current situation, but a lot of progress has been made and a lot of exciting progress is on the horizon! I hope this post helps :)",2021-02-04 22:47:15

722,These are the 6 U.S. Senators at fault for killing the crypto industry in the U.S. Vote them out!,4725,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p1njuf/these_are_the_6_us_senators_at_fault_for_killing/,1065,"You've probably heard by now that, despite our best efforts, the U.S. Senate *failed to even vote* on any alternative to the horrible cryptocurrency provision that may kill the crypto industry in the U.S. This means that wallet producers, miners, Dapp creators, and basically everyone else will now require KYC of their customers/users or face harsh penalties from the IRS (the U.S. tax collector). These are the 6 Senators (listed in no particular order) who are responsible for the cryptocurrency disaster in the Infrastructure Bill. We will remember their actions and vote them out!

**Rob Portman (R-OH)** – drafted the disastrous, original cryptocurrency provision. When Toomey, Wyden, and Lummis introduced an amendment to fix the provision, Rob Portman publicly supported their amendment before blindsiding everyone with his own, worse amendment. Portman has proved himself to be a puppet for Janet Yellen and Wall Street.

**Mark Warner (D-VA)** – wrote the worse crypto amendment with Rob Portman, creating chaos in the Senate and causing Portman to recant his previous support of the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment. Because the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis was bipartisan and already widely expected to pass, Mark Warner’s co-authorship of the Portman amendment gave the Portman/Warner/Sinema amendment bipartisan sponsorship, giving it legitimacy to contend the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment.

**Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ)** – did not write the worse crypto amendment with Portman and Warner, but signed onto the amendment later to give it legitimacy. Kyrsten Sinema was one of the two leaders of the Senate Infrastructure Bill negotiations, along with Rob Portman. Once Sinema signed onto the Portman/Warner amendment, it became extremely difficult for other senators to publicly oppose the Portman/Warner/Sinema amendment, because it became a symbolic rejection of the Infrastructure Bill as a whole. This is why we only saw Republicans who already indicated they would vote against the Infrastructure Bill publicly commit to the better, Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment.

**Bill Hagerty (R-TN)** – 99 out of 100 Senators voted to expedite the Infrastructure Bill, which would have led to an opportunity for proper consideration, debate, and voting on the cryptocurrency amendments. Bill Hagerty was the ONLY Senator to vote against expedition. This forced the Senate to either take a vote to end debate and force a vote on the *whole* Infrastructure Bill within 30 hours, or to take a recess until September 13, 2021. Once the Senate voted to end debate, it meant that the cryptocurrency amendments would not even be voted on without unanimous consent of all 100 Senators. Hagerty effectively increased the number of Senators who needed to support a crypto amendment from 60 to 100.

**Richard Shelby (R-AL)** – 99 out of 100 Senators consented to vote on the mega-compromise Toomey/Lummis/Warner/Portman/Sinema amendment which was substantially similar to the good Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment. It was widely expected to pass, and we would have seen a resounding success. However, Richard Shelby was the ONLY Senator to refuse to consent, because he conditioned his consent on the Senate also approving $50 billion in military spending. When this idiotic ultimatum was rejected, Richard Shelby objected to the cryptocurrency amendment, leaving Portman’s disastrous, original cryptocurrency provision intact.

**John Thune (R-SD)** – the Senate Minority Whip. His ONE job is to make sure that the Republican senators vote with party leadership. He failed this TWICE by allowing Bill Hagerty and Richard Shelby to block the crypto amendments. How hard could it be to get corrupt politicians to vote with a corrupt party? Just promise to give the Republicans candy if they vote with the party. I used that strategy to win my middle school student government election in a landslide.

Also, fuck **Janet Yellen**. The unelected, 74-year-old Secretary of the Treasury was the person behind the cryptocurrency provision in the first place, as well as the Portman/Warner/Sinema amendment. It’s no surprise that the woman who took $7.2 million in speaking fees over the last two years (almost entirely from banks) was behind this attempt, at every step of the way, to systematically destroy cryptocurrency and DeFi. And of course, because she was unelected, we have no way to vote her out.",2021-08-10 11:46:56

Many of you suggested some really good improvements to the bot and I am currently writing all the suggestions down in a plan to potentially release this as an application.

Here is a quick breakdown of what the bot does:

* It buys bitcoin if Elon talks positively about bitcoin on twitter
* It stops the loss at 5% and takes profit at 10%

And here are potential improvements based on your feedback:

* The bot should be able to work with multiple coins and keywords
* The bot should be able to follow multiple Twitter handles and ideally other websites too
* The bot should tweet the rocket emoji whenever it places a trade 🚀
* It should be user-configurable and ideally come with an easy to navigate user interface.
* The bot ideally analyses the weight of the influence on the crypto market for each influencer chosen

Your input made motivated me to release an official application for this project, and if you're comfortable with coding and would like to contribute drop me a message if you would like to collaborate on it!

Do they have any idea how long a bear can last and how many coins can be lost and eaten up forever.

The bear market knew to “eat” the coins that were in the top10 so we only have BTC, ~~ETH~~ LTC and XRP out there that survived it from 2013.

Dip is one thing, crash and bear is another. And it can last for a long period of time.

What bear brings to us:

\- General distrust in cryptocurrency

\- Investors are losing confidence in the market

\- Prices are decreasing for possibly longer period of time

\- Negative talk of cryptocurrency in news, social media, mainstream media and so on

And no, I don't wish for a bear market so I could accumulate more coins. Some dips are totally fine. For me DCA is also a good strategy for a long term investor. Why the hell would I want bear market? It is not that fun at all!",2021-12-06 09:46:27

Why crypto (and other markets) will crash tomorrow -

1) The Chinese stock market will open after 2 days of holiday. Everyone is expecting a major crash here

2) Evergrande is expected to default on its loan payment, the same debt which Blackrock owns quite a big bag of, sending out a potential ripple effect

3) Sources out of Beijing say that the CCP are unlikely to bail Evergrande out (this point is just speculation)


So in conclusion, there are bigger dips coming.(I’m not suggesting to anyone to sell, just to be prepared for bigger dips)

Edit: When I wrote this, BTC was at $42k and ETH was at $3k, they’ve now dipped to 40K and 2.7K.

Edit 2: Seems like Evergrande is working on bond payments for Chinese banks and the CCP injected cash into the banking system.  We are safe for now, but unless Evergrande comes up with a payment plan for international institutions I’d say this isn’t completely over.

Edit 3: Crypto market is up, has been for a few hours now. Evergrande has made their loan payment. The only uncertainty left is their international payments.

Edit 4: Evergrande defaulted on its international debt :)",2021-09-21 18:30:03

Daily transaction count (15k) is the lowest since 2017.,4676,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pt3dl0/there_isnt_doge_adoption_the_opposite_is/,1607,"[https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/dogecoin-transactions.html#alltime](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/dogecoin-transactions.html#alltime)

This is why DOGE was nothing else than FOMO and viral investing. This is why DOGE will fall from the Top10. Will it come back? Sure, after crashing to 1 cent, the viral cycle can start again. And it will be temporal again.

15474 transactions. The lowest in almost 4 years, in the middle of a bull run. We had 20-30k transactions in 2018-2020, during the crypto winter.

How many transactions other chain process?

* Cardano 80k
* Bitcoin Cash 100k
* Litcoin 150k
* Avalancha 170k
* Bitcoin 250k
* Tezos 300k
* Ethereum 1.2M
* Algorand 1.3M
* Fantom 1.5M
* Polygon MATIC 5.5M
* Binance Smart Chain 9M
* Solana 15M (not counting votes)

Most of these chains are doing transactions not far away from their ATH. DOGE ATH happened in 2013. 8 years ago!! after that, it had 8 Pumps and 7 dumps. The 8th dump is happening right now. The code is a fork of a fork of Litecoin done in 2013, and it hasnt improved sifnicantly since then. It doesnt have the throughput to be a global payment system. Elon just loves the attention and the marketing points. After being in the media so long time, adoption decreased. Investors multiplied by 10, by almost none of you are actually using it, just investing for the profits. 

Invest as you will, just be aware, that those funds could be lost. Don't invest more you can afford to lose. 

PS: Why do I attack DOGE? Because I think it's a distraction for Crypto and damage its credibility. Hundreds of thousands of people will be burnt in this FOMO, and will distrust crypto in the future. It has provided ammo to skepticals, and the reputation damage will take time to repair. Shiba, RocketCum, and many other shitcoins, are the worst of this space.",2021-09-22 08:52:16

FTX isn't a fucking bank. They aren't supposed to have fractional reserves. They arn't allowed to lend out your assets. They are an Exchange. They are supposed to have all customers funds covered 1:1. Anything apart from this means they were committing fraud

2) They inflated thier Balance sheets 

This is simple enough. If 1) is true then it means FTX is insolvent. They can't pay back their creditors. Namely customers who they lied to that the funds were available 

Alameda also inflated its Blc Sheet by increasing the value of its own assets. Thus pretending they are Solvent. A little company called ENRON did this too. They used this inflated Blc to get credit to gamble on crypto

739,I worked for a crypto start-up for two months. It was horrible.,4649,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/teq4rx/i_worked_for_a_crypto_startup_for_two_months_it/,1094,"A few months ago, I wrote on this sub that my objective for 2022 was getting a job in crypto. It worked : I got hired for a start-up in December, and started to work for them in January. I resigned a few weeks ago, and now I want to share my (not so good) story with you.

(I won't name the company in question, because I have signed a NDA. But rest assured : you never heard of it before, and it's not a major player in the ecosystem - it's not even a minor player.)

First of all, **the level of disorganisation and chaos was absolute madness**. Each morning we had a different objective, based on the most recent trend in the market. NFTs are becoming popular? Let's do NFTs! This particular token is performing well? Let's buy it, even if it's at ATH! One of our product doesn't work anymore because we rushed a bug-fixing patch? Let's pretend that never happened and let's keep pushing rosy marketing articles!

I know that start-ups are notoriously disorganised. I get it. But you can't expect to be a profitable company, or even be a productive member of the crypto ecosystem, if you can't even define your objectives and stick to it.

Secondly, **we cheated.** What I mean is that we bought bots for our TG channels, we faked users in our Discord, and we partenered with dubious ""influencers"" to make it look like our products were far more popular than they really were. This kind of stuff is what gives crypto it's bad reputation to the outside world, and I deeply regret having been a part of this for a short time.

And finally, and I think this is the most important part : **the founders didn't care about the crypto ecosystem at all**. Their main objective was making as much money as quickly as possible. We were acting like an evil hedge fund, precisely the type of institution crypto is supposed to fight. 

I felt sad. I felt like a scammer. So I quitted. And, keeping in line with everything I wrote before, **they didn't pay me for my last week of work**. They just ghosted me.

So... yeah. 

I don't want to discourage people from getting a job in crypto. I still believe in the future of this industry. **But I would advise to stick with the well-known companies of our ecosystem**, and not waste your time in little-known start-ups that have big dreams, but can't deliver. We have a long, very long way to go before we become a respectable industry.",2022-03-15 14:22:31

I spent them about a week later for diamonds in a minecraft server.

Now, you might be wondering why I wouldn't regret spending what is now worth half a million dollars on fake rocks in a videogame, but the more I've thought about the more I've realized:

- At $3 bitcoin still felt like a fun experiment. I had NO idea what I had. 
- More importantly, let's say I kept those coins. When Bitcoin hit $20 I would have been tempted to sell. When it hit $100 I would have been verrry tempted to sell. $1,000? I'd cash out for sure. There are so many milestones where I and many of us thought it was topping out where I without question would have so;d, especially in the early years. The likelihood of me keeping those coins for a decade with the assumption that today's prices were even possible at all is extremely unlikely.

Today, VeChain Foundation hosted the rebrand event showcasing the consortium chain VeChain to the public blockchain VeChainThor. This event was an invite-only occasion for media and partners with a live stream to YouTube. During the event, Sunny Lu and Luca Crisciotti of DNV GL talked about the past, present, and future of VeChain. 

Sunny clarified that VeChain's uniqueness is not only technical but also its understanding of ecosystems. He pointed to the governance and economic models as examples. This sentiment was echoed by Luca as he assured everyone that after meeting with countless blockchain solution representatives he chose VeChain as the partner for DNV GL because of their understanding and dedication to the customer. 

This mindset has lead to over 180 opportunities for VeChain in 2018. Many of these opportunities are left unannounced, but in the course of the event, VeChain announced several new partners and opportunities including the University of Oxford Mathematical Institute, Carbon Bank solutions, BitOcean ICO, food sourcing, and BMW Group. 

Also in this event, Sunny Lu showcased three decentralized applications (DApps) that are being built to cater towards the mainnet launch. Those DApps include:

* VeVID -  KYC and digital ID maintenance solution that can be native to all VeChain applications or partners. [You can read the official announcement here.](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechains-first-official-public-infrastructural-decentralized-application-vevid-cd97bdf98670) 

* VeVOT - A voting service that will be initially used by the VeChain governance model. This solution will be available for other general voting events to be logged on the blockchain such as government voting and board votes. Voting results will be audited by independent partners and certified on the blockchain. 

* VeSCC - Smart contracts on the VeChainThor mainnet can be categorized into certified and uncertified, which can be checked in the explorer. The certification of smart contracts covers various aspects including the identity of the owner, the legality of the purpose, and the security of the source code. 

At the event, the carbon bank solution was made public to raise awareness that VeChain is building solutions alongside DNV GL that will monitor, analyze, and reduce the carbon footprint. This solution is being used and researched by universities (Tsinghua University), businesses, and government bodies.

In this event Sunny Lu took the time to introduce the University of Oxford (Mathematical Institute) as a partner in the VeChain ecosystem and will be working on assuring the economic model is working as intended for VET holders, VeThor users, and new customers. It was also mentioned that Japanese FSA certified partner BitOcean would be the first ICO on VeChainThor.

Luca Crisciotti left with words of encouragement of VeChain “We are not talking about pilot projects, we are talking about solutions that are working for real cases.” Luca went on to say:“DNV GL is a company with over 150 years of history. And unfortunately, this is something we can not share, because you [VeChain] were only born a few months ago. But we do have something in common, and it's a bright future. So thank you Sunny for the partnership and this amazing event.”

My case is more delayed and severe.

The account explorer shows its perfectly correct. But i cant find my 333230 XRPs, worth more than 300000 USD. What can I do? For 9 days, I just click and click refresh button every seconds. 

It's all about my money. Why this terrible situation happen in my life. It's a nightmare. Someone cheers me XRP price elevating. But i dont have that XRP, now.

It is not going well.,4543,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q3o83x/bitcoin_became_legal_tender_in_el_salvador_a/,2527,"This is a post about the cryptocurrency situation in El Salvador. I am posting this again because the previous one was removed by a bot. It is not about price, it should not be marked as such.

Twitter post as proof of living in El Salvador: https://nitter.net/samsungsv19/status/1446177713413308428#

A month ago, Bitcoin became another Salvadoran currency. I understand that my previous posts looked like complete FUD, but that's not my intention. I wanted to share how all of this affected Salvadorans, specially for those who barely have money to get a ""decent"" mobile device.

Adoption is going pretty bad, specially because of identity theft. There have been hundreds of reports about people using the Chivo Wallet to steal money. The government is being quiet about it, and no one is offering a solution to the problem:


>https://diario.elmundo.sv/denuncian-robo-de-datos-personales-para-uso-no-autorizado-de-chequera-chivo/


That is not a case of phishing or people authorizing full access to the Chivo Wallet, this is way worst. The Chivo Wallet ""has facial recognition"", or so they said however it is just storing a picture, any picture. There is no validation whatsoever, and because of that people are no longer using/trusting Bitcoin:


>https://imgur.com/a/7vRTft8


And yes, I know you are going to say that this does not have anything to do with Bitcoin, but you gotta understand the Salvadoran culture: Once something fails, everything associated to it becomes bad. It doesn't make sense, I know, but that's how things really are here, and it is affecting adoption.

Businesses are reporting low adoption. 93.1% of small/medium business are reporting ZERO Cryptocurrency transactions. The free bitcoin bonus was either converted to FIAT or spent in groceries, after that usage crashed.

What about the protests? Did people finally accept the Bitcoin Law passed by the Salvadoran congress?

Not quite.

There were two protests:

- September 15th

- September 30th

Both protests were massive, huge turnout. People are angry, and mad. Salvadorans do not want The Bitcoin Law:

September 30th Protest against the Bitcoin Law

What was President Bukele's response?

Just like Donald Trump, he chose to mock the protests via Twitter:

>http://imgur.com/gallery/NhAqko0

Three protests, and instead of listening to the people, he decide to just ignore them, and make fun of them.

Are Salvadorans protesting because they dont understand technology? Are they afraid of changes? Why they don't want free money?

Well, salvadorans are protesting because this whole Bitcoin Law thing has been shady. First of all, remember the ""Not your keys, not your money"" thing that you see pretty often here? We don't know where the 700 bitcoins that the President Bukele bought are. Who is our broker? How much did we pay for those bitcoins? What about the free 30 dollar bonus? How much did it cost? All information regarding the purchase of Bitcoin is classified. 

What about the ATMs? We only know that a known Bitcoin ATM company provided them, but the cost of those 200 ATMs is classified information because of ""National Security"" (whatever that is). 

But hey! El Salvador is mining Bitcoin with vulcanoes! 

Yeaaaaaaaaah, about that.... It is true, but it is not a new well, nor new infraestructure. The mining farm is located in a poor town called Berlin, Usulutan. LaGeo is the name of the state-owned company that produces geothermal electricity for the Oriental Region (Usulutan and San Miguel), however due to the mining farm, we are starting to burn more coal to provide enough energy to the region. Electricity costs are rising up, but our President puts profits over people.

Profits over people you say? Covid cases/cases are going up, but Bukele is not restricting movement because that would be a fatal blow to the Chivo Wallet adoption. You see, if people cant go outside they cant go to the Chivo Offices to set up the wallet and learn how to use it. Bukele cares more about profits, and spends his days tweeting about bitcoin prices (Trump would be so proud):

What is next? Another protest is scheduled for October 17th, and rumor has it that it will be bigger than the previous one. Will Congress concede and roll back the Law? We dont know.",2021-10-08 02:16:36

To get mass adoption to the levels we want, we need an iPhone style event into the market, by some massive and already well-established company. Sure LG and other companies made touch screen phones before Apple did, but Apple did it better and they made it much more simple to use. They've dumbed down the whole thing, so even half-trained monkey could do it.

This is what we need in crypto. Right now all we have is a crap-ton of different chains, bridges, multiple ecosystems, multiple wallets etc. it's just too much for the average Joe. Heck, even for myself it was truly difficult to sell one coin the other day (not gonna shill here any names). It took me around 12 different steps, moving between bridges, converters and so on etc. before I was finally able to cash it out to FIAT without destroying myself with high fees to make it worthwhile. Sure, I could just cash out via traditional methods, but I'd lose like 15% of my coins doing that. This stuff should be automated a long time ago.

But this will take time, a lot of time. The true adoption will start when we are allowed to just add crypto to our Google Pay or Apple Pay by scanning a quick QR code from our crypto wallet, without thinking two secs or giving a single fuck if our coins are going to disappear because we've mistyped one or two letters in the wallet. Or because your wallet supports coins X, Y, Z but not coins A, B, C. Until then ""mass adoption"" is just an empty slogan that won't happen for another 10 years or more.

Within hours, a trading desk Jump Capital agreed to replenish the entire amount so that the liquidations calamity is avoided. The loss of the peg due to the hack could have sent the network into cascading liquidations arising out of leveraged positions. In stepped a VC to save the day.

[Lost $320m? Thats fine.. we got you covered. ](https://preview.redd.it/adhsxhuefqf81.jpg?width=1172&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ed759f03c763a7cfd07d8bb35a03cff7aa3921d)

The fact that VCs are ready to cover these kind of losses shows that the entire Solana ""ecosystem"" is just one big sham propped up by these same VCs. They dont want their baby to die just yet. Apparently Jump Capital owns a significant stake in Wormhole and is ready to sink such a huge amount to cover losses. 

In Solana, the top 1.34% of addresses owns 99% of the circulating supply. Most of the supply was sold to early VCs and insiders at a massive discount to retail. Insiders and bad actors like Chamath have publicly joked about using Solana as a vehicle to play their pumps and dumps out, leaving retail to hold the bags when the sham unfolds. 

VCs dont just sink in $300m to save the day, unless they have already taken out 50x that amount - that is what Solana has enabled them to do already.

So a buncha SOL Shills be like hurr durr even ehtirium had hacks and was saved by fork. Well the DAO hack was solved by cryptography solutions (forking), not by VCs stepping into save the day. If you think both are the same, you clearly understand NOTHING about crypto whatsoever. The DAO hack and the hard fork took over a month to assess, propose solutions and resolve. It wasnt an overnight fix, like what solana is known for. 


When Solana goes down - over night fix.

When bridge hacked? - overnight fix. 

How long will Solana depend on overnight fixes to bail the network out?

Edit: The mental gymnastics of SOlshills is just incredible. They have clearly consumed all the kool aid in the world to be supportive of this kind of institution manipulation. Yes, other projects also have VCs, and Eth projects have also been hacked. Yet none of the ETH projects have been bailed out in this manner by VCs and institutions. I have been extremely critical of ETH too. There is virtually a hack a day on Eth due to poor code or implementation or bugs, but none of the ETH project hacks have been ""replenished"" by institutions. If an ETH projects gets hacked and people lose money, well you are shit out of luck. As evidenced by hundreds of hacks and scams before. 

The first major Solana hack, and less than 24 hours later the institutions propping up solana claim they are bailing everyone out. If this is not the least bit suspicious to you, then you are just being slow boiled alive. 

Solana itself is a long term pump and dump that is devoid of any decentralisation and fundamentals except a bunch of whales propping it up. The tokenomics of every single Solana ""ecosystem"" project is puke worthy - from Serum to Raydium, Bonfida, Saber etc all have massive supply in the hands of a few, an incredibly high FDV and a low float and funny unlock mechanisms - perfect conditions for institutions to keep dumping on hapless retail investors like the ones supporting Solana in the comments here who dont understand anything about crypto or finance.",2022-02-04 03:17:30

Now that Coinbase One offers insurance, I'm not even going to worry about cold storage. I sleep better this way. I don't care about all the ""not your keys not your coins"" arguments. I have a legally enforceable contract with Coinbase now that I pay for.

True, it's price is kinda steep at $30 a month, but to me it's worth it. It comes with no trading fees which sweetens the pie. Also comes with ""priority"" customer support, which I tested and only had to wait 2 minutes before I was speaking to a live agent.

The coin has seen an insane increase over the past couple months.

TRON has recently launched its algorithmic stablecoin [USDD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usdd/). The algorithm governing the stablecoin’s dollar-peg is an arbitrage trade between USDD and TRX, Tron's network’s native token. *Hmm... this reminds me of something but I can't put my finger on it....*

Now here's this week's best offer! [You can earn up to 57% through sun.io's LP!](https://imgur.com/a/JoFQgSH) What a great deal.

According to [Defillama](https://defillama.com/peggedassets/stablecoins) USDD is #10 stablecoin by market cap, with a 20% increase over the past week, this figure is up from $90 million recorded during its day of launch on **May 5, 2022**. *Hmm... I have a vouge memory of something that happened in early May 2022...*

Oh and we haven't even checked the **project's founder, Justin Sun.**

Let's get started:

Justin Sun launched TRON's whitepaper during the ICO craze in 2017, days before China's ban on ICO's. He raised $70 million and left the country. Sun had been **tipped off by Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance.** Does this also sound familiar....? 

On top of that. [it's been also reported that he copy pasted the project's whitepaper from another coin](https://coincentral.com/community-accuses-tron-plagiarizing-whitepaper/). This only adds to the pile of cards that his so called ""algorithmic stablecoin"" is a scam waiting to collapse.

It is no coincidence that Justin also left China, days after the ICO ban was announced.

On top of all that, it's been reported that:

* He hosted a ton of fake giveaways in 2019 announcing fake winners and retracting prizes.

* He announced fake partnerships with big organizations such as Liverpool F.C., who have denied connections.

* It's been reported that Justin has sold most of his TRON coins after the ICO and bought a large chunk of ETH. Some say he owns more ETH than the projects' Co-Founder Vitalik.

[You can read more here](https://www.theverge.com/c/22947663/justin-sun-tron-cryptocurrency-poloniex)

So, what do we make of all these? Justin Sun, the creator of TRX and USDD, not only literally copy pasted everything, he has also been involved in a huge amount of sketchy dealings and scams. 

My hope is that people like Justin and projects like LUNA and TRX are wiped off entirely from the market, for this is the only way to move forward and build something meaningful.

It didn't end well for him.,4448,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pobe0r/crypto_scammer_got_in_touch_with_me_he_didnt_know/,832,"I had often heard that if you mention you are new to crypto, lots of scammers will DM you and offer to trade for you. But the thing is, I hadn't received any of those DMs so far, and I was looking forward to, because I was once a scambaiter and I missed the good old days.

Well, this ""crypto trader"" contacted me out of the blue three weeks ago, and I happened to have some free time in my hands. He stole the pictures of some real guy who works with blockchain technologies. He really wanted to talk about crypto, but I tried to deviate from this topic and tried to flirt with him instead. I provided some fake info about myself, and acted like I was very lonely and very happy to finally talk to someone. I wanted to waste his time, but he kept asking about crypto.

Day by day, I tried to gain his trust. I acted very naive and grateful for his advice. I even told him someone had DM'ed me to discuss crypto, and that I suspected it could be a scam. He instructed me to block those people as soon as possible. One day, I asked to do a voice call, but he couldn't because apparently that would disrupt his crypto signals, whatever that means. He claimed to be from the US, which I'm sure he wasn't, judging by the way he expressed himself.

He wanted my crypto asap. He was going to trade it for free because he loves me so much. I told him I was going to receive an inheritance in crypto, but that my attorney was the one managing it. I asked whether I should tell the attorney about our ""relationship"" and how he was going to trade for me. He ordered me not to tell anyone about ""us"". Unfortunately for the scammer, the ""attorney"" would be back around the second week of September. This bought me some extra time to keep wasting his.

I never thought I would end up pulling this off, but what I did has all the characteristics of an advance-fee scam:

1. The ""attorney"", who was the custodian of my crypto inheritance, told me he was holding 2.74 BTC on my behalf.
2. I went to see the attorney and signed some documents, where I gave him permission to transfer all my crypto to the scammer. I gave scammer a made-up case id and asked him to contact the attorney.
3. Scammer contacted the attorney but didn't provide the id. This delayed things (also because I was busy in real life). Id was requested again.
4. Scammer provided the id and his address for the transfer to take place.
5. Attoney informed scammer that, to avoid scams, and to pay for administration costs, he would have to transfer 0.05% fee in advance (0.00137 BTC).
6. I woke up to a formerly empty wallet that now contains the 0.00137 BTC, I couldn't believe it! This is [the transaction](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/d5a2c2c2802c9e2d630c51cbf62450155cf6263067f586a96650777910b8a3a4).

Now, I have this weird feeling, because I hold BTC that might have been stolen from someone else. I might hold it for a few months and then donate it to the food bank or something, I don't know. At least I hope he learned a lesson and will devote his time to something other than scamming people.

Here are some images with the highlights of our 3 weeks of interaction:  [https://imgur.com/a/mnFJhj1](https://imgur.com/a/mnFJhj1)

By the way, Reddit does not allow you to report a profile, all I could do was report the pictures he stole from someone else, and I also warned that someone else.

Edit:  After getting the fees, the attorney told him that his activity was suspicious so the fees had been frozen and he was going to be investigated for fraud and impersonation.

Hours later, I messaged him as myself telling him the attorney had called me  and that he had found out he was a scammer. I said I couldn't believe he had betrayed me like that! The last thing he said was that he loved me.

Love you all so much  **😎** 

\-------------

Hi everyone, Nutty Joe here with another epic post.

&#x200B;

None of us know how much longer the bull market is going to last, nor if we will reach the previous All Time Highs seen in May. However, having completed extensive research in the last few days, I can tell you with complete confidence that **the bull market will continue through to New Years, and beyond!**

&#x200B;

I present to you three points that confirm my theory:

&#x200B;

1. Bitcoin will hit $100k in 2021
2. Bullish investors outnumber Bears
3. Warren Buffet told me ***personally*** that the Bullrun will go through to 2022.

&#x200B;

**----- 1. Bitcoin will hit $100k -----**

Figure 1 indicates BTC’s path from August 2020 to August 2021 (present), represented by the Blue Line.

The Red Line indicates Bitcoin’s path to $100k for the rest of the year. This has been determined based on ***weeks*** of research I have performed (which I will not bother to explain as I am too tired; just take my word for it).

&#x200B;

[Figure 1. The Red Line indicates Bitcoin's price change from August 2021 to New Year's. As you can see, we will easily hit $100k by then!](https://preview.redd.it/fkw7kqclq3i71.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=82cc40567932ee15fb8e306919f8546cecd90b68)

&#x200B;

This is irrefutable evidence isn’t it! What a great analyser I am. Bitcoin to $100k by the end of the year is a certainty, and therefore indicates the Bullrun will continue on strongly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**----- 2. Bullish investors outnumber Bears -----**

This part requires very complex calculations. I have mathematically determined that there are more Bullish investors than Bearish, through an extensive algorithm.

This sub has 3.3 million members; all of these people are hopeful that the Bull Market will continue on to 2022. Dividing this number by the current population of Earth, 7.9 billion, gives us Figure 2:

&#x200B;

[Figure 2. Don't worry if these calculations are too confusing. Maths can be hard!](https://preview.redd.it/oyi2v7lyq3i71.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fc13e6b8f6bf6bbd30ff9eba9cdbdfe61f6155d6)

&#x200B;

From this, we can see that 42% of people in the world are bullish on crypto. That’s nearly half of ***everyone alive***! Therefore, we can safely guarantee that there are more Bulls than Bears currently.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**----- 3. Warren Buffet confirms the Bullrun will last until 2022 -----**

I managed to get a hold of Mr Buffet, a famed investor and long-term supporter of money. I sent him the following message:

&#x200B;

[Figure 3. Thank you Mr Buffet for contributing to my epic research!](https://preview.redd.it/ggltrxcbr3i71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7054b97f298bc3f53302fdce15c6a007b4e83f5f)

&#x200B;

Astonishing! Warren Buffet believes the Bullrun is going into next year. He is one of the richest people alive: therefore we must take his word for it!

&#x200B;

**----- Summary -----**

Thanks to my excellent research, I have determined with 99.7% accuracy that **the Bullrun will continue into 2022.** Please trust me on this: would I ever lie to you good people?

&#x200B;

Crypto has hopes of solving many problems but people aren't able to wrap their minds around it (Nfts made it even harder). On top of that most of crypto is hard. Part of the reason most people are still using exchanges to store crypto.

Of course none of it would matter if it is possible for it to be conveniently part of peoples life and is solving problems.

789,"Speculation on why the dump (and rebound) happened today, and what's to come.",4426,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ngf3u0/speculation_on_why_the_dump_and_rebound_happened/,1138," This is purely speculation. Some of this will be talking about the world  outside of cryptos - specifically other markets, equities, and a bigger picture. If that's not allowed on this subreddit, totally understood, but I thought I'd bring an outsiders perspective to this, since I am utterly unsurprised by the events of the day and have been expecting this (or something like it) for some time. 

This is not meant as financial advice. Do your own research. Make your  own decisions. If you think I’m right, great! Act on it. If you think  I’m wrong, great! Act on it. Do your own thing. I'm just some guy on the internet, and my opinions are about as valuable as a guy spinning a sign on a street corner.

Finally, this is not intended as a FUD post - if you come to  the same conclusions I have, there will certainly be fear involved, but hopefully no uncertainty or doubt, and you can make decisions that lead to healthy financial outcomes for yourselves and loved ones. I’d  like to post a TLDR that everything is going to be okay at the end, but I  don’t necessarily think that’s going to be the case. I think scary and volatile times lay in our immediate future. I have no crystal ball, and whether that's tomorrow or 3 months from now I don't know, but I think we're facing choppy seas. 

I believe we're about to see a major market correction, and the volatility in cryptocurrencies is just the beginning. I believe this will hit every sector of the economy, from housing prices to the value of the USD. I believe cryptocurrencies in particular will see extreme volatility, both in a downward trajectory and later, an upward trajectory. 

Here are some core premises this speculation will be based on. 

1. Cryptocurrencies have not yet found a price equilibrium that reflects  their ultimate value. Currently, they are a speculative asset.

2. Despite not having to file their positions on their 13F forms, hedge  funds and investment banks are very much involved in cryptos.

3. Cryptos are a relatively unregulated market, which makes pump and dumps a much easier prospect. 

4. In their current form, cryptos have not achieved any real detachment  from the US dollar. Meaning, that when the market goes up, cryptos go  up, and when the market goes down, so do cryptos. Their promise of  breaking from the USD an becoming an intrinsically stable currency appears to not have matured  for the moment. 

Here are some ancillary premises. 

1. In order to shore up the economy during covid, the government did a  few things: it started loaning money at 0% interest like crazy, and it  reduced collateral requirements to increase liquidity in the  marketplace.

2. Collateral is heavily rehypothicated right now. An example of this  goes as follows: company A has a 20 year treasury bond. It’s keeping it  on its books as collateral to meet its margin requirements so that a lender will give it money to invest on margin. Company A then proceeds to lend  that treasury bond to company B. Company A keeps it on its books though, because  they can recall it as collateral any time they need to in order to meet their own collateral requirements. B now goes to  a lender and says “hey, I have this treasury bond as collateral,  will you lend me some money?” This process is repeated several times, until you eventually have an absolutely massive amount of margin being lent out on a single treasury bond serving as collateral. Go take a peak at the repo market. People are literally paying borrow US Treasuries to hold as collateral because collateral has been so overleveraged. 

3. During Covid, the economy has suffered. unemployment is up, supply chains have been stressed, companies have been going out of business, and savings have actually gone up for the lucky people who have been able to hang on to their jobs, and they're not out spending money. This has lead to an abnormal situation in which the stock market, which is typically (at least loosely) tied to the economy and goes up or down in tandem with the economy as a whole disconnecting - meaning that while the economy is doing poorly, the stock market has boomed to a new ATH at an unprecedented rate. 

4. Margin debt in the financial markets has seen an enormous spike in the last year. The market as a whole is extremely leveraged - which means that small events can have enormous impacts, and wider market implications. 

And finally, here are some more speculative premises. These concern what I believe is, and will be the catalyst, and the hope for crypto in the future, but they're not essential for the argument that the market correction is imminent. 

 

1. Naked short selling is an enormous problem facing the US financial markets. To understand why, it's important to understand the difference between short selling (locating and borrowing a share, selling it, and promising to buy it back later on the hopes of a lower price), and naked short selling (creating a synthetic share that was never issued by the original company and selling it). 
2. Naked short selling has long seen lax oversight by the regulatory agencies. Through a series of revolving doors and allowing the markets to run their own regulatory agencies, this enormously profitable business gets a blind eye from the regulators tasked with stopping it, because those same regulators are ultimately also the ones who profit from it when they move back into the private industry. 
3. Naked short selling is the financial equivalent of creating a counterfeit share, selling it for profit at the cost to the shareholders and company, and having 0 intention of paying it back. This tanks company value, and effectively steals value from actual shareholders. It has been used for decades to drive companies out of business. Occasionally, you get a company like Overstock that beats the odds and sees a short squeeze followed by a share price resurgence, but it frequently results in a company going out of business. 
4. Naked short selling can be hidden in a variety of ways. While people frequently turn to the short interest as a way to examine how shorted a company is, there are a variety of methods that market makers can employ using options chains to create FTD's (shares that are a failure to deliver because they never had them in the first place, and never intended to find) and then recycling those FTD's ad-infinitum until the targeted company goes bust.  
5. When Covid hit, several hedge funds, banks, and market makers decided which companies they were going to short into oblivion, and profit off of their demise. They picked companies that would in theory be particularly hard hit by a reduction in customers that were used to entering a physical location.  
6. For many companies, those efforts failed. The companies did not go out of business, and these Hedge funds and market makers find themselves in a position where they cannot close their positions, they are losing money every day. The two most well known companies in this position are AMC and GME. 
7. Shorting a company exposes the short position to infinite loss. 
8. There has never been a perfect storm of a short squeeze as GME. AMC may squeeze to a lesser extent - but it has no where near the amount of shorts that GME does. 
9. There are a variety of catalysts that can cause GME and AMC to squeeze. Contrary to common opinion, the surge in share price in January and February was due to what's called a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze, and the shorts have not covered.   


Which brings us up to today. I believe that multiple hedge funds and market makers are in very deep on their short positions, and that they are fighting on a day by day basis at this point to stay solvent. I believe that if the US financial market is the overloaded and unstable Jenga tower, these companies are the live hand grenade placed on top of the tower, and have had the pin pulled.   


However, whether or not they're the catalyst is relatively unimportant in the overall picture - the markets are over leveraged on crazy high margin right now either way. There was a liquidity test last week, and the results were not published, but the markets have been...sketchy at best since then. Because of how over leveraged the market is, I believe that virtually any hedge fund that gets margin called is too big too fail, because it's walking on that much of a knifes edge. And when it comes down, it's going to take everything down with it, from the real estate market (both commercial and residential). I believe that speculative assets in tech and crypto are going to be particularly hard hit. The house of cards is staggering like a drunk man that just got hit in the head, and doesn't know that he's bleeding internally and about to die of an aneurysm.   


So why did Crypto across the board see such a huge (and similar across different currencies) dip followed by a massive rebound? Because as a largely unregulated asset, it's extremely ripe for pump and dumps. Hedge funds can use it to inflate their assets on paper and get access to margin.   


And I believe that yesterday they got margin called. GME has been sitting above what the speculated margin call price should be for a day or two now (although nobody is certain what the exact price is at the moment, the speculation is between 170-180) and their lenders were demanding better collateral than the crypto they had on their books. When you get margin called, you have some time to come up with the required collateral before it's considered a default and your broker starts liquidating your positions. I believe they met their margin requirements this morning, managed to hold off default for another day, and immediately started pumping crypto again. They simultaneously shorted GME down and dropped the price from $180 to $165, thus probably lowering their margin requirements as well.   


Again, I can't stress this enough: while I believe that GME and the hedge funds and market makers massive short position is involved, the argument that a bunch of hedge funds got margin called yesterday is not dependent on that - the market has been dipping the past few days, and it could simply be a matter of being over leveraged and seeing a few red days in the market that caused a margin call. All of the people all over the world that have been buying GME at unprecedented rates for the past 4 months could be totally wrong. But even if they are, this crypto dump still has the looks of a margin call. Both BTC and ETH have dropped over 50% from their ATH this morning before the rebound. The timing of hitting their low points 3 minutes before OCC-007 (which raises collateral requirements for the month) came into effect seems telling to me that somebody was really close to going under.   


And I believe that this is the first of many margin calls, and eventually, somebody is going to default, and the dominos will begin to fall, leading to a massive market correction (or collapse, depending on how you want to look at it) that leaves everybody hurting bad.   


What happens next, and how I personally plan to respond is more up in the air. The Fed can respond to this in a variety of ways. They can opt to fire up the printer and start devaluing our currency to try and buy our way out of debt with a worthless USD, or they can opt to embrace the pain and raise interest rates and create a few decades of pain and stagnation while we dig our way out of a deep depression through long term austerity. Whether or not I (and everybody else betting on the GME thesis) are right will also play a big role in what happens next. If we are correct, it's going to create what is essentially a black hole for liquidity in the markets, as money flows out of the hands of the wealthy and leaves big reliable blue chip companies, and moves into the hands of GME holders. If that's the case, money is going to be flowing into the hands of people who have a deep, deep distrust of the US financial system and the regulatory agencies, and I anticipate a massive boom in crypto's as people look for places to store their money outside of US financial market control. If my speculation is correct, we'll see bitcoin hit the teens (or maybe even single digits) before they begin to climb back up, and we'll eventually see surging and setting new ATH's in the near future afterwards, and a similar story for ETH. I'm less certain about the less well known coins - my assumption is that they will not see nearly as much of a rebound as BTC and ETH, but who knows.   


If the GME thesis is not correct, but the economy does crash and the fed Fed fires up the printer, I still anticipate a huge rebound in crypto - it is, afterall, still ripe for pump and dumps, and at the end of the day, it is in theory a pretty good place to store value in an inflation resistant location.   


If the Fed opts to raise interest rates and embrace deflation over at the opposite end of the spectrum though, than cash will be king and crypto will be utterly screwed for the next 5-10 years I'd bet. If hyper inflation is a great way of turning a Weimar Republic into a Nazi Germany, deflation and austerity are a great way of turning into Greece. Neither are great options though. Hopefully some smarter people can come up with something better.    


TLDR: If the market crashes, which is very likely, Crypto is set to take an enormous dip with it. Every hedge fund that's dipped its toes in is going to dump it like a hot potato, and if you thought it dipped fast this morning when it dropped over 20% in an hour, what comes next will make your head spin. But for now, they met their margin call and live to fight another day. Eventually though, somebody is going to trip and the economy is going down with them. And when that happens the Fed will be forced to embrace either inflation or deflation, and I expect Crypto to rebound if they choose inflation. Additionally, if the theory of GME turns out to be correct, there's going to be quite a few new millionaires with money burning a hole in their pocket to be spent, and they'll be looking for speculative inflation resistant assets that are not subject to corrupt US regulatory agencies. There's always the possibility that over the next few months, companies slowly manage to deleverage and increase their collateral without causing a market wide panic for the exits, and simultaneously the GME theory of everything is wrong, and the markets continue largely as they have been now.   


Whatever the case, I believe it's going to be a bumpy ride with more volatility in the near future, and I wish all of you the best. Good luck to everybody.",2021-05-19 19:44:49

795,"No one seems to actually know what a smart contract is, yet are trying to explain them. Here's the actual explanation of what they are.",4396,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oe790p/no_one_seems_to_actually_know_what_a_smart/,657,"Smart contracts do not ensure payments went through, and they do not create decentralized casinos or banks.  In fact, they offer no guarantees about decentralization whatsoever.

They CAN be used for these things, but what they really are is much simpler.

Smart contracts are immutable scripts that exist on the blockchain.  They maintain a state (i.e. they store data) and they have functions that can be called.  That's it.

The only way to interact with a smart contract is to call one of its functions.  There are read-only functions that can be called on any Ethereum node to read some data out of the contract, and then there are functions you can call that modify data in some way, but those require sending a transaction and paying gas.

You can use this functionality to do many things, but it is important to note that they do NOT ensure anything.  You can write backdoors into smart contracts.  Smart contracts can have admins that have the ability to yoink all the funds out of it.  There are categories of bugs that allow a malicious smart contract to attack other smart contracts if they can get that contract to call one of their functions.  

Like all code, smart contracts can be written poorly or well.  The guarantees come from the implementation, not the nature of smart contracts themselves.  The same is true for banking software or other non-blockchain apps.

The key difference is that the code for smart contracts is (mostly) immutable.  Once they are deployed, the code cannot be changed.  However, there are some exceptions to note:

* Smart contracts can be written so that they are destroyed by calling a destructor function.  After that, the contract becomes invalid and can't be interacted with
* A smart contract can be modular and call other smart contracts.  You can ""upgrade"" one smart contract by deploying a new modular component and pointing the old contract to the new one with updated functionality.

Don't get caught up thinking that smart contracts are some amazing thing that solves all of our problems when it comes to creating safe, verified transactions.  They are just code, that's it.   People can still write shitty code.

EDIT: As others have pointed out, I'm speaking specifically about Ethereum smart contracts.  Other blockchains could have smart contracts with different properties, but I imagine they would be mostly similar.",2021-07-05 13:20:36

I get constant recommendations in my Youtube of this clickbaity fuckers, even though I have selected ""Don't show anymore"" on Youtube, but I guess it doesn't care. And lucky me...because Bitboy has released a video titled: ""My $10 Million Crypto Portfolio REVEALED (Shocking Holdings)"".

First of all, there is nothing shocking in your holdings, besides the amount of coins that you have already accepted a sponsor of and didn't disclose it, which is illegal.

And this got me thinking of some coins that he has proclaimed that have a ""100x"" potential, so I decided to watch the video, and see if he puts his money where is mouth is. (I only know where he puts his mouth in for those thumbnails)

Well Lo and Behold...that must be one of the biggest self exposes I have seen in a while.

He has SEVERAL videos titled something similar to: ""BEST Low Cap Crypto Gem of 2021"", and GUESS WHAT!! He doesn't hold 2/10 coins that he pumps in those videos. But he does hold 300k USD...hmmm, where has that come from?

I know that one of his sponsored videos was about SOUL, where he named it the BEST LOW CAP GEM, and HE DOESN'T OWN IT. This is more than proof that he dumps soon after his video airs.

Frontier...same thing...naming it the coin with the best potential he has seen, and it is only 0.4% of his portfolio??? Yeah right. See it for yourself if you are interested...

Since Coin Bureau has a pretty good reputation in this sub, I decided to look at the past performance of every crypto that he has recommended in his 'Top crypto picks' videos to see whether his recommendations are worth listening to. 

To do this, I compared the price of the cryptos he recommended at the time the video was released to their ATH, and to their current prices. I also compared the returns from these recommendations to the returns of BTC and ETH, 2 of the least risky picks in this asset class. All price data was sourced from Coinmarketcap.

\*If true ATH was before video release, I used the ATH after video release.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

The majority of Coin Bureau's recommendations that came out in 2021 performed well in comparison to BTC and ETH. From the data we have, many of his recommendations are profitable in the short term (usually a couple of months). However, Coin Bureau hasn't been around for long enough to prove that he can pick out good long term projects (at least a few years). Overall, I think the data shows that if you want to diversify into alts, Coin Bureau's recommendations are generally a decent choice if you're too lazy or don't have the time to DYOR.

&#x200B;

# TLDR

Coin Bureau's recommendations are generally profitable in the short term (usually a couple of months). However, one year's worth of data really isn't that much, and I think you should always have more in BTC and ETH than in any of these recommendations combined.

But after the Shiba frenzy there has been this project called AnubisDao on ETH, it was a cute dog page that they promised it would have the mechanics of OlympusDAO. It had several famous devs involved and they managed to collect 13000 ETH or $60million aprox, they rugged everyone taking all the funds out of the contract. And now inside that team they are pointing fingers between each other and no one knows where the funds are. This happened 3-2 days ago.

What surprises me is that this was a rug where famous devs have been involved and no one is talking about. ""DYOR"" ""you should put your money on people that has been proved right before"" ""trust on respetable people, not on randoms"" etc etc...in this case it has also been proven wrong, and 30 times the amount of SquidDao have been stolen.

Crypto is a dangerous space, random projects that tells you in your face that you cannot sell your funds (basically telling you I'm gonna steal from you), or others that seem like a good bet but they fk you up anyways.

And today I noticed on the homepage that I reached 1 million trackers and ads blocked, which is pretty shocking. Additionally, I was essentially PAID to browse as I normally would -- with the recent run up in the price of BAT this amounts to \~$165. Obviously not a significant amount of money, but I think the concept is awesome regardless.

The browser itself works well, and the only issues I have with it are:

* You can only ""cash out"" via an Uphold wallet, which is KYC and has high fees.
* Some issues with receiving BAT payments on time.
* Can't enable BAT rewards on my iPhone, due to Apple's policy.

To those of you on the fence, I would suggest at least trying Brave. You can enable / disable BAT rewards (to earn BAT there are some pop-up ads that appear) as you please, so there's really no downside to giving it a shot. I think there are decent arguments on both sides about the value of the BAT token, so you can determine for yourself if enabling BAT ads are ""worth it"" for you.

**EDIT: The chart cuts off at 2016...which is apparently making some people think there was a bear market sometime after 2016. Let's have a look:**

https://preview.redd.it/0us34zsk3jd81.png?width=2108&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1dc74739e55bf6b7d86dd56ea6798fa0163c4719

**There was no bear market. There was a relatively small crash in 2020 as everyone panicked over Covid. That's not a bear market. This picture also shows you that it's even worse, the market has been absolutely parabolic for almost 2 years.** 

That's the S&P 500 index. Notice something? Every ten years or so there's a severe downward correction which lasts 1-2 years. In the early 2000s it was the tech bubble, in 2008/9 it was the mortgage crisis. As you can see here, we've been in a sharp uptrend for over 10 years now. This uptrend has been fueled not in small part by record low interest rates. This is turn has resulted in parts of the market being hopelessly overvalued, a prime example being Tesla.

Now look at the crypto charts, specifically the top 50 alts. Most of them have had absolutely face melting pumps over the last 18 months. Do you think that's just going to keep going up? Their valuations are now so ridiculous that 'crypto market caps' are basically a meme, completely detached from reality. Of course market caps are hardly ever a true reflection of what company is worth, but they are a reflection of the amount of speculation in the current market. Just to look at a few:

Cardano MC $36 billion, doesn't have fully functional smart contracts, lots of promises while continually underdelivering, if at all.

Solana: MC $30 billion, has been unusable for the last 48 hours, has suffered multiple outages over the last 6 months which lasted up to 17 hours.

Dogecoin: $18 billion MC....don't think I need to go into more detail on this one.

Ethereum: $288 billion market cap, supposed to disrupt the global banking industry (along with everything else), meanwhile it costs $200 for a simple ERC20 token swap.

BTC: $665 billion market cap, supposed to be the future of digital store of value, meanwhile, has lost more than 50% in value over the course of 2.5 months.

etc....

The point is that these market caps aren't a reflection of the current states of those projects, but rather their promised states at some future point in time. Unless that point in time is very close as in a few months away, that's not sustainable. I personally don't think that point in time is very close, as almost nothing in crypto currency works as advertised.

**What would a multi year global bear market mean for crypto?**

\- BTC bleeds more than stock market

\- ETH bleeds more than BTC

\- Alts will bleed even heavier than ETH and a good number will never recover. You have to remember something very basic here: if an alt your holding loses 90% of its value in the bear market, it has to pull a 10X just to get back to its previous price.

**Further complication:**

DCAing into projects is obviously the way to go in a bear market, but it becomes more difficult to predict what projects will have merit the longer the bear market continues. Will your favourite project still be relevant in 2024 or will it be replaced by something that hasn't even launched and won't until 2023? The longer the bear market lasts, the more likely that outcome becomes. Do lots of research, try to keep up with the tech developments in crypto. The next Solana or Luna is probably being planned as I write this. Try to find it.",2022-01-23 22:06:12

You also may be familiar with the fact that on January 28, 2021, Robinhood infamously [restricted the trading of various stocks](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/), making positions close-only. 

Lastly, anyone who has used the platform for trading cryptocurrency is likely familiar with the ""scheduled maintenance"" that conveniently obstructs you from making trades at times when the market is making a significant movement. 

Still, I know that many people are too complacent for their own good; they will be fully aware of Robinhood's corruption, but they will use the platform anyways for the commission-free trading. This brings us to our next point...

# Are there actually no fees on Robinhood trades?

Short answer: no.

When you buy cryptocurrency, Robinhood makes money on the artificially wide bid-ask spread. What this means for you is that Robinhood will try to make you pay more when you buy crypto, and try to offer you less when you go to sell your crypto.

Just for demonstrative purposes: lets say you are trying to buy 1 BTC. Robinhood might tell you that the price is $50,000. Then, they will pair you up with someone who is selling 1 BTC for $49,990, and pocket the $10 difference. 

Still confused? This analogy may help:

>Intentionally quoting a trader a higher price so you can make money on a greater bid-ask spread is akin to shopping mall outlets raising their prices before running a steep “discount” to lure customers.

So please, even if you aren't concerned about Robinhood's trading restrictions and shady management, you should be aware of the way that they profit off of your cryptocurrency trades. **They still charge you a fee, it is just hidden.

They are telling us that BTC, ETH and such are basically worthless because it doesn't have a physical existence and are not backed by a government.

Well, those people conveniently forget that fiat money doesn't exist, either. Well, most of it.

You see, banks are allowed to leverage their holdings in what is called the fractional reserve banking system. If you deposit 100$, for example, they only keep a fraction of that money in cash (let's say 20$), and they use the remaining 80$ to generate yield, generally by lending. What that means is, if every customers of the bank tries to cash out in a short amount of time, **the money won't be there, because it's been lent and doesn't exist anymore**. 

When you deposit cash in a bank, what you get in return is basically a glorified IOU. Should the bank get into trouble, your cash could very well disappear.

Now, of course, the governement can intervene to prevent such bank runs. But it's always in the favor of the rich. That's what happened in 2008-2009 : the fat cats got bailed out, while the ordinary citizens went into bankruptcy. And it only works in stable countries ; when you live in a failed state, the government won't help you in such a crisis.

Compare that with crypto. If you are in control of your keys, and assuming their are not compromised, **nobody** can access your funds without your permission. Not the wallet devs, not the government, not the DEX. Nobody. **You are in full control, and you will still be in control even if the governement of your country collapse**. 

In that sense, I think that cryptocurrencies are actually more real then fiat money. Decentralised networks are much more resilient then centralised authorities, and therefore are more likely to survive in the long-term.

I think we still got a few years ahead of us before the mainstream media catches up with this revolution. Until then, I will accumulate as much as I can.",2021-12-02 14:14:37

834,Finally did it: I made a crypto trading bot that automatically places orders on new listings before they get added on Binance,4234,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qc9zoe/finally_did_it_i_made_a_crypto_trading_bot_that/,1031,"So I've been working on this project for about 2 months now, and I've learned quite a bit about how new listings behave, and how important the Binance Annoucement page is.

My inital idea was to create a crypto trading bot in Python, that constantly checks if a new listing is added on Binance, essentially by checking the total number of coins at any given time. I tried out different variations on this, end even increased the speed to buy within 0.1 seconds on a new coin being listed.

After looking at the results, and talking to some of you on here, it turns out that the spike in the price upon listing the coin is actually the peak of the iceberg.

The real activity seems to happen once Binance Announces that they will list the coin, and not upon the listing itself.

Have a look at the chart for FIDA/USDT below, and the time Binance made the announcement:

[FIDAUSDT](https://preview.redd.it/q6bnt5noynu71.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=35ab7423f89f9c162619f36459f9cf36d1e13072)

&#x200B;

Looks like people are fomoing hard into new coins on different exchanges in anticipation of a Binance pump, ironically creating the pump themselves.

So with that in mind, I built a crypto trading algorithm that listens to the Binance announcement page, and once there is an announcement for a new coin listing, the bot extracts the symbol of that coin and places a Buy order on Gate .io.

The tool will automatically place buy and sell orders and it has a trailing stop loss feature, meaning that it should sell at the optimum time, in theory.

I chose gate .io because according to what I've seen and what some of you have said, this exchange seem to list many of the coins that later make it on Binance or other bigger exchanges.

The tool is free to use for everyone, but I suggest running it in Test mode at first, as I still need to confirm that everything runs fine. Annoyingly, gate .io doesn't have a testnet which means I had to test the buy/sell logic by placing real trades - not ideal.

But I've included a test mode for the tool itself, so it won't actually call the gate .io API, it will just simulate the trades locally.

I'm currently waiting for new annoucements to test out the profitability and will report back. For anyone interested in the project or who may want to test this out themselves:

It’s not working out how I thought it would at all.

How do I go about getting a refund. It was quiet an expensive purchase so I’d like to get my money back.

I have a few other coins I would like to get refunds on, the one with the dogs on them doggy coin and shib in you coin. 

I have asked all around the local shops in town but no one seems to know anything about them. I have tried phoning my friend that told me to buy them but his phone must be broken because when he answers he can’t hear me.


Thanks in advance",2022-06-18 20:50:02

A transfer from an external wallet/platform to GDAX appeared in all of our Coinbase accounts, and then said that it transferred successfully to our GDAX accounts, but then never showed up in our GDAX accounts. So it would appear our money is gone, because our balances are zero.  We’ve all opened tickets with support with absolutely no responses, posted on their subreddit, and called to only be on hold for hours without any help. I really don’t know what else to do except try to get us on the front page of a bigger crypto community.

More details about this issue are here https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/7mx88o/urgent_coinbase_to_gdax_transfer_disappeared/?st=JBUBPP35&sh=a19f1463

Thank you so much for your help to anybody who can spare an upvote to bring some attention to this.

If anybody from Coinbase finally wants to help, my support ticket number is 3221822

UPDATE: there’s a comment response from the Coinbase CEO, saying they’ll get to our tickets. Since I doubt they’ll respond again to me (and my balance is still 0 on GDAX so basically this whole issue was still not enough to fix our problem) - here’s my response:

What proof do I have that my coins are not lost? My balance on GDAX is 0, and my LTC balance on Coinbase is 0. This kind of thing should be a priority issue if people are getting balances of 0 on GDAX with an automatic send to their wallet transfer from Coinbase to GDAX like this. I’m even more frustrated that with 3.5k upvotes and a response, my LTC balance is still 0 from an error on their side.

One last clarification: I do not have any pending transfer issues (these I’m familiar with an have learned to wait). The transaction on the blockchain finished, the funds even appeared in my Coinbase account. The automatic transfer from Coinbase to GDAX (which has happened at least 5-10 times with no issues for me) this time withdrew the money from my Coinbase account and said the deposit to GDAX was completed. But my balance is 0 for LTC on Coinbase and 0 on GDAX, so this last move to GDAX (which is supposed to be instant, and says completed) zeroed my LTC balance. My balance has been 0 LTC for over 3 days now. This has nothing to do with their wire transfers, although I really feel for everyone still waiting on their withdrawals and hope they resolve that soon.

UPDATE: it’s been 4 days and still missing all of my LTC

UPDATE: 5 days now. No more holidays. I have no faith in crypto exchanges anymore.

6 days now. What a joke. I’ll post the next update in 6 months when my support ticket gets addressed and if I’m lucky they’ll fix our problem.

FINAL UPDATE: Fixed finally after 6 and a half days.  My account has been transferred the litecoin that were missing, thank you so much everyone on reddit for bringing attention to this. I really owe everyone because I had no power at all over this situation and I like to think this post helped get Coinbase to at least address this issue. It would appear others are still having problems with this Coinbase to GDAX transfer, or at least haven’t had their missing coins returned yet, just as an FYI. Thank you so much again everybody!!!!",2017-12-31 13:20:49

The OP follows and RTs stuff like this

This quinn investment guy is a known fraudster who cooks up conspiracy theories, just have a look at his profile lol. 


Bullshit that has already been denied, like Tether holding Evergrande.. 
Infact this nonsense claims 78% of Tether reserves are Evergrande, which is total lies.

And that OP RT's nonsense like this, wishing for crypto to burn, but you all are assuming he is posting his ""unbiased opinion"" on bitcoin law. Lol


Edit:

Some comments are pointing out that I havent deboonked what that OP has said. I did actualyl debunk him last month, but then realised he isnt having honest debates but is just putting out propaganda. Given that he isnt acting in good faith, and is a buttcoiner, kinda pointless for me to debunk moreover, he is clearly lying that he wants to see crypto succeed, and instead has a very biased agenda. He is not debating in good faith. If you check his profile, he had posted that BTC would be a failure even before the roll out. Literally, before the plan was implemented and went live, he claimed it would be a failure. Anyone really expect this guy to be unbaised at this point? 

Coming to the protests, yes there are protests, but the protests are to do with politics rather than bitcoin. You will find one or two guys carrying an anti-bitcoin banner in the entire protest. Most of the protests are purely due to political reasons, that have nothing to do with Bitcoin. All those pictures he has posted as proof are all from protests shared on twitter, they have nothing to do with bitcoin except that fact that Bitcoin is implemented by the president, against whom all the protests are targeted. 

That guy claims Bitcoin rollout is ""not going well"". 

Stats from Google app store and IOS app store prove him wrong. 

The Chivo wallet is still #2 on ios app store, ahead of most viral apps like FB/ Whatsapp/Twitter/TikTok etc

https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/apple/store-rank/sv/all/


And on Android play store, the wallet is the #1 app too..

https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/google/store-rank/sv/all

The Chivo app is pretty much TOP on both app stores. Quite some failure huh! Definitely not doing well...

Just because there have been some issues during rollout doesnt mean its a failure or its not going well. Many mass implementation programs have problems initially, infact even the US covid stimmy checks took a while to arrive and there was implementation delays. Later, [WaPo reported that over 1 M checks went out to dead people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/06/25/irs-stimulus-checks-dead-people-gao/). Was that a failure too? 

Now lets look at some real stories that are success:

Over 3 million  users have downloaded the wallet. 

[More users in El Salvador are now using Chivo / have a bitcoin wallet than they have traditional bank accounts.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2021/10/07/in-el-salvador-more-people-have-bitcoin-wallets-than-traditional-bank-accounts/?sh=7ac1bb5020b5) - This alone is a massive win, in a country where huge amounts of people are unbanked, they have now instantly been given access to the world's most open and fair financial network. 

 Already, Brazil is considering following El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as well.


A country implementing BTC is not a race to the finish, it is a long term program. OP knows that too, but since he is a biased propagandist, he wants to put out hit pieces on a monthly basis 

That guy is just grinding his grudge against the president who he clearly hates, and using this sub as an outlet to air his political hit posts.",2021-10-08 14:07:14

He knows nothing about crypto, but trusts me and acknowledges the volatility. I, in no way, persuaded him to invest in crypto.
Having said that, here’s what happened;

I downloaded a portfolio app on his phone so that he can track the crypto I bought and also so he keeps up with what I’m doing with his money. Naturally, I keep plenty of funds in a stablecoin (in this case usdt) so that I can buy potential dips.
One afternoon I kept getting calls from him on my workphone (he never calls me on my workphone). Flustered, I picked up the phone during an important meeting, fearing something bad had happened. When I picked up he said the most boomer thing I ever heard him say ‘Hey, I have been tracking this coin usdt you bought, and it is not doing much, it’s not fluctuating at all, but I’m really, really expecting a rise soon, what do you think?!’

I found it absolutely adorable and dumb at the same time. I explained everything to him and we had a good laugh about it. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share this giggle I had. Hope it also brings you some joy in these trying times.

EDIT: Wow, this post really exploded. Thanks for all the awards and love kind strangers. I see there is some controversy about the whole 'Tether' thing. I appreciate you guys looking out for me and my father. I truly do. Having said that, I don't feel the need to fuel this discussion. I think everyone is entitled to his own crypto choices and my dad trusts me enough to make those choices for him. It was not the intention of this post to start a tether-riot. It was simply meant to share a funny crypto-related story. Oh, and for the people saying this is a repost. I did try to post this about a month ago I think, but it got instantly deleted by the mods because I didn't have the required Comment Karma to post on this subreddit. I just thought I'd try to share my story again now having the required Karma. Anyway, I hope all of you have a wonderful crypto-journey. I'm still reading all the comments. It truly makes my day!

844,"Crypto.com introduces Worldwide Account Protection Programme, protects victims of unauthorised transactions of up to USD$250,000",4199,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s8eaoz/cryptocom_introduces_worldwide_account_protection/,1763,"Just read the security report from Crypto.com in an official press release issued barely 3 days after the recent hacking.

I think this is impressive not just for CDC but for the crypto market in general, in building confidence in cryptocurrency. This is so vital considering how crypto is still held in suspicion by many.

To quote them:

>Crypto.com is introducing the Worldwide Account Protection Program (WAPP). WAPP offers additional protection and security for user funds held in the Crypto.com App and the Crypto.com Exchange.  
>  
>WAPP is designed to protect user funds in cases where a third party gains unauthorized access to their account and withdraws funds without the user’s permission. WAPP restores funds up to USD$250,000 for qualified users; terms & conditions apply.

Some noteworthy things you must do to qualify for the WAPP:

* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all transaction types where MFA is currently available, 
* Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transaction,
* Not be using jailbroken devices, 
* File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; and 
* Complete a questionnaire to support a forensic investigation.

The WAPP will begin rolling out in select markets starting 1 February 2022. 

CDC has also :

1. migrated to a new 2FA infrastructure, with a longer term plan to migrate  to true Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
2. Introduced an additional layer of security on 18 Jan to add a mandatory 24-hour delay between registration of a new whitelisted withdrawal address, and first withdrawal.
3. Full audit of the entire infrastructure
4. Engaged with third-party security firms to perform additional security checks + threat intelligence
5. And of course, all affected customers have been fully reimbursed.

[Here's the link to the report.](https://crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-security-report-next-steps)

EDIT: Sincere thanks for the awards!  
EDIT2: I really didn't expect this to blow up. Thank you all for the awards! I just want to add that, yes I am a CDC customer, but I also hold many other tokens and coins, and I'm well aware of the amount of suspicion and misunderstanding many people have regarding crypto. It's really important that, as time passes, the crypto world shows that it cares, it is relatable and it adds value. That's why I decided to share about this. I am also learning that other exchanges offer similar - but maybe it's not marketed as well. Marketing is awareness.

851,I spent 5 hours researching what a DAO is so you didn’t have to.,4173,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ragxwq/i_spent_5_hours_researching_what_a_dao_is_so_you/,867,"**What is a DAO?**  Standing for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, a DAO is an internet-native blockchain-derived investor-directed venture capital fund organization managed by all members. At its core they have an objective to provide a decentralized business model for all future enterprises. Mark Cuban called them “the ultimate combination of capitalism and progressivism.”

One important aspect is that all code is open-source. This is done with the aim to eliminate human error, manipulation, and third parties, by having an automated crowdsourced process of decision-making. Unlike a company, DAOs have democratized organizations allowing all members to vote for any implemented change. The DA organization is represented by transparent computational rules, secured on the digital ledger across the internet, hardened against forgery by timestamping, and disseminated as a distributed database. The DAO is controlled by the members; no managers or basses are needed.

>Bitcoin in essence is the first fully functional DAO with programmed rules and functional autonomy through consensual protocol; the miners and nodes signal voting through support.

**DAOs need four things really;**

* A set of rules,
* A funding token,
* Voting right provisions,
* A clear structure & roadmap

|**DAOs**|**A traditional corporation**|
|:-|:-|
|Flat hierarchy.|Hierarchical.|
|Voting required for any changes.|Changes demanded from sole party, voting   may be offered.|
|Voting outcome implemented automatically.|Tallied internally and outcome handled   manually.|
|Services handled automatically in a decentralized manner.|Human handling, centrally controlled automation, prone to error and manipulation.|
|All activity transparent and public.|Activity private.|

**Creation of a DAO:**

* Step one; create a smart contract that once launched the rules can only be changed by coded governance system.
* Step two; sources of funding must be determined and governance must be engaged, typically funded via token sale that come with voting rights.
* Step three; deploy smart contract on the blockchain from which point onward stallholders will decide future organization. The dev(s) have no more influence than any other stakeholder.

&#x200B;

**How can I join a DAO?:**  Just invest in their token, and boom, you’ve joined. The smart contract token you just bought establishes the DAO’s rules, most likely you have to stake the token or another in the DAO to get voting rights and influence operations. This is typically done by deciding on and creating governance proposals. The fact that you need to stake to create proposals is to prevent spam proposals, and only (typically) proposals will pass if a majority of stakeholders approve (different percentage majority per DAO; specified in the smart contract).

**What’s the point? Where is the need?**  Are we all not internet native, or soon will be? DAOs are internet-native organizations with technological advantages compared to traditional companies. They have and establish a higher level of trust then say, the classical corporate hierarchy. Only the open source code needs to be trusted which is transparent thus auditable and verifiable at any time. This solves the economic principle-agent-dilemma where there may be a conflict of priorities between a group and those making the decisions for the group. The answer is community governance where incentives are aligned. There are charity DAOs, ones for NFT investments, for funding projects by Black women and non-binary artists, for funding women and non-binary crypto founders, some are exclusive social clubs, and others are for-profit business applications. I’ve even seen freelance DAO networks of contractor.

>**Examples of DAOs:**  Aragon, MakerDAO (MKR), DAOstack, DASH, JennyDAO, Jelurida, SharkDAO, DAOhaus, RaidGuild, Proof Of Humanity, Opolis, BanklessDAO, MolochDAO,

**Downsides of DAOs:** No organization is perfect, decentralized or autonomous or not. This is extremely new technology that continues to attract criticisms over legality, security, and structural issues. As a DAO can be distributed across multiple jurisdictions, there is no legal framework. One may have heard about ‘The DAO’ crashing, as back in 2016. ‘The DAO’ was launched on Ethereum and raised $150 million in ETH (largest crowdfunding effort at the time) but a few days later developers expressed concern about a bug that would allow malicious actors to drain funds, and while a proposal was set forth to fix it an attacker took $60 million worth of ETH. At the time, 14% of all circulating ETH was invested in ‘The DAO’. Chaos ensued and a hardfork was implemented on ETH. Those who disagreed moved to support an earlier version of the ETH network, which became known as Ethereum Classic, or ETC. Point being if any gaps in the contract framework aren’t closed before launch, it can lead to potential theft and money loss. *There is no such thing as a fully D & A organization.*  Depending on governance, there are only various levels of decentralization. While the network may have independent but equal network actors, the smart contract rules themselves will always be a centralized loss of direct autonomy; architecturally and geographically decentralized yes but logically centralized on the protocol. Upgrading of code is often delegated to experts who understand techno-legal intricacies of code and are therefore a point of centralization.

**Future of DAOs:**  Despite the potential for DAOs to revolutionize the industry, and be a disruptive force to corporate structuring as a whole, they face security and legality issues.  As we all know the SEC claims some blockchain based companies might have made illegal offers of unregistered securities. There is also a lack of understanding about cryptocurrencies from new investors, not to mention the technical competence one needs to understand the computational infrastructure and consensus mechanisms within the smart contract to feel good about investing in it. It’s not all bad though, Wyoming just became the first state to recognize DAOs as legal entities. DeepDAO says there are about 181 DAOs, with an ecosystem’s total assets under management (AUM) of $13.4 billion.

Somewhere, in some business boardroom, people are trying to figure out how to integrate self-driving cars into DAOs of autonomous taxi drivers. You order an Uber and it comes, no company, just code.",2021-12-06 20:31:53

Each time people were saying the same things like ""Yes, now this is definitely the one that will replace Ethereum and I haven't missed the boat on it"" and guess what they never did. This is the boat I believe ADA is in. It isn't all just about the tech. Smart contracts are currently not as big in the world to the point where superior tech makes that big of a difference (hence why all the other ""Ethereum killers failed"" even with better tech). Ethereum has such a huge network effect as well as first-mover advantage where I can't see it getting flipped any time soon, especially with EIP 1559 coming out in July and ETH 2.0 being fully released (within a year?). At this point, most people/whales that are buying ETH are not in it for the tech but for what it is - the second most valued crypto (and generally more stable than the altcoins). Do I see ADA raising in value in the short-term or mid-term? Probably (assuming they deliver on what they say). Do I see it ever competing with ETH in the long term? Definitely not.

Invest wisely",4116,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qnmqzs/i_experienced_my_first_rug_pull_today_please_be/,2195,"Last night I heard about a launch on a new coin, “crypto hippies”. A lot of tiktokers were promoting it, it had a really well made website, all social media platform, telegram etc.. so it seemed promising to me. I decided to set an alarm for 9:00 AM which was the launch time. And I decided to invest a little over $3,000 into it. My hope was if I get in early I can possibly 5-10x my money and get out. Purchased the coin and watched the buy and sell orders fly in. Then, a massive amount of buys and ZERO sells. I didn’t think much of it but I go and shower for work and I come out and it goes from .07 to .0001. They dumped everything, no one was able to sell. The developers cashed out and I lost everything. I honestly am at a point in my life where my job is making me so depressed so like a lot of people I’m looking for a get rich quick method, and meme coins seem to be what the hype is all about now. But because of my irrational decisions and not enough research I am now down $3,000. Which isn’t a lot to most people but this was pretty much all of my savings. I know that’s a stupid decision to make but it made sense to me and I’m just doing my part and warning people to always do research and be cautious and never invest money you can’t loose. I am loosing my mind over this honestly, I can’t focus at work I can’t eat, and I probably won’t sleep. But lessons aren’t free in life. And I hope this can help someone out there before they make the same mistake I did. Take care!",2021-11-05 22:51:07
864,Anyone else think the idea of the Metaverse sucks?,4114,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qyicgx/anyone_else_think_the_idea_of_the_metaverse_sucks/,2015,"Is it just me who thinks the Metaverse can flop?

Don't get it it twisted, I love games but I think the Metaverse can and most likely will flop. Virtual worlds do not appeal to me, especially to the extent that it sounds like it is going to. Some people are referring it to the ""new reality"" and the ""next internet"" but I just see it as a go at a overpriced VR game that nobody will pay for.

The amount of money that will have to come out of this will have to be insane. With the amount of money put into this they would end up having to resort to selling thousand dollar gear and equipment used just to play in the Metaverse. And most likely along with a chunk of Crypto needed to start. The lack of need for a Metaverse will prove in people not paying the thousands of dollars to play this.

I can also see a hard sell/dump in the 'Metaverse Cryptocurrencies'  as the majority have been going up with hype, and I feel the Metaverse will be a lengthier process than the average holder thinks, which will possibly result in them becoming inpatient and maybe selling.

And if it does succeed, fair enough. I guess I'm just a normal guy and not a multi billionaire and may not see the potential of this project.",2021-11-21 00:05:31

868,Tether has not reported its supply for 3 days now. Its supply has also fell 8B in the 5 days before that.,4107,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/urtbhx/tether_has_not_reported_its_supply_for_3_days_now/,1193,"Tether is usually reports its supply on their official website once every day, at an inconsistent time. That's why you can see stairs like this on a market cap chart:

[Tether market cap in the past 7 days - not counting the depeg it's the same as the supply](https://preview.redd.it/dymvdlxi03091.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7eadfebaa9152b041ab672f80141650c6f572a00)

If you go to their website you can see their current circulating supply with the same latency:

[The last update date is not true - it's actually May 14 and the supply exactly the same as it was 3 days ago](https://preview.redd.it/1vtvjvqez2091.png?width=1298&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f763445a9b7961b31377f00c587402898257753)

So they're not only not reporting the supply, but they're also lying about updating it. The only reason why would they do that is because their supply fell significantly in these 3 days and they don't want more people to follow. If they didn't hide the 8B that dropped during 5 days, how much are they hiding from these 3 days?

Tether is getting more and more shady with everyday. They will probably try to buy back some of the withdrawn Tether with their reserves, decreasing their actual reserves and shooting themselves in the foot further. Of course Tether collapsing is not a good thing, many people will lose their money and a crypto crash will follow. Under any circumstances, don't hold Tether.",2022-05-17 18:46:26
869,Everyone Here is Seriously Missing Out on The Wonderful World of DeFi and Web3,4095,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/u9qgxv/everyone_here_is_seriously_missing_out_on_the/,1087,"Sometimes I feel that this subreddit is still stuck in 2017 talking about dead coins, whereas there’s this whole wonderful world of defi and web3 filled with life changing gains that I never see talked about here. But I want that to change so I’m putting together this huge list of all the cool things you can do in defi and web3.

# Trustless Loans

Defi is revolutionary for this. With Maker (or many other protocols), you can deposit collateral & take a loan on your assets to use in the real world wherever. This process involves no bank, no intermediary fees and offers much higher yield than trad finance. In fact, Tesla just did a real estate backed loan with maker dao.

&#x200B;

# Lottery

Want to join the lottery? Well, PoolTogether isn't just any lottery. It's a DeFi protocol allowing for ""no loss lotteries."" How? Users are able to deposit funds, & yield is given to a verifiably random address in the pool. Losers can then still withdraw their assets.

&#x200B;

# Aave Flash loans

If I told you that you could get millions of dollars in assets in seconds, with no bank, with no collateral, and at no risk to the lender... I'd probably sound crazy, right? Well, flash loans on Aave are built to be repaid in the same tx, otherwise it'll revert and fail. You can do this to perform arbitrage trades and other cool things.

&#x200B;

# Yield farms

Not interested? Do you prefer to just hodl your coins and not think about them? Why not earn some passive interest in the process! Head over to YFI & join the yield farms, with many different options to choose from. The YFI community works hard at developing strategies for their vaults, acting like a high interest savings account. Users can deposit & immediately start earning yield!

# DEX liquidity providing

Speaking of liquidity mining... Do you have assets that you’re bullish on and that you want to put to work? Many DeFi protocols such as Uniswap, Sushiswap, & Curve are in need of liquidity. Deposit tokens of your choice to start earning yield in different tokens, & earn trade fees on swaps! Careful though as this exposes you to impermanent loss.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p4oqabd0o5v81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5338ff39d9d6de5d6aea6df24d2d336988652e5c

# Lido (staked eth)

Do you hate having to worry about opportunity cost of locking up your eth? Of course, that's not a problem for DeFi. Simply access liquid staking derivatives in order to unlock liquidity and put it to use. sETH represents staked ETH on Lido. After depositing, these sETH can be used in DeFi.

&#x200B;

# Curve

This protocol is an absolute behemoth with about $20 billion in TVL making it the largest protocol by total value locked. Visit Curve to start earning complex, double digit yields on your holdings. Curve has incentivized stablecoin pools, which people use to trade high volumes with minimal slippage, and even conduct arbitrage for yield.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hk5c8ph2o5v81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f6a5a50ca7ee20779e9bb3b7e08ca911875d66c8

You can stake your CRV tokens on convex finance to earn yields from curve trading volume and bribes from protocols trying to incentivize liquidity. This is a whole rabbit hole that I will make another post about.

&#x200B;

# Abracadabra

Have some more appetite for risk? Go beyond just yield farming and take on leveraged yield farming! Some protocols allow users to deposit interest-bearing assets, and borrow stablecoins Tokens earning yield on CRV can be used as collateral for Abracadabra, for maximized composability.

# Defi pulse index

Don’t want to think about it all too much and just wanna passively invest in an index? Of course it's possible. There are a handful of DeFi native indexes that offer exposure to a basket of assets in a single, convenient token. This can be an index of the top tokens in DeFi, a basket of NFTs, or anything else you could imagine.

870,50 crypto terms you should know,4092,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nh6lzx/50_crypto_terms_you_should_know/,427,"If you're just getting started with crypto, or are struggling with all the terms that go around on this subreddit, this list is for you.

Behold the top 50 crypto terms you should know!

* **51% attack**

A 51% attack represents the situation where more than half of the computing power within a given blockchain of one person or one concentrated group. This ensures that this group gains full control over this blockchain. For example, they can stop all mining, stop all transactions or spend every coin of this specific blockchain infinitely often.

* **Address**

A cryptocoin address is the location where you store your crypto coins and from where you send and receive your coins. You could compare it with your home address. This address usually consists of a whole row of numbers and digits, which looks something like this: 1KXghhUZRVFmfk9Jreo3vvuV3HDoCJyYJZ. This address is the public part of the two encrypted keys (see private and public key) that are required for the holder to verify a transaction.

* **Airdrop**

This is a kind of giveaway for founders who determine a particular cryptocurrency, giving those coins or coins away. The promotion is for a short period. This is done to publicize the tokens and distribute the tokens.

* **Altcoin**

This name is used for all crypto coins that are not Bitcoin (alternative coins).

* **Altseason**

This is the term given when money flows to altcoins faster than Bitcoin. In other words, when investors buy more altcoins than Bitcoin.

* **AMA**

Ask me anything. A (mostly) new crypto project likes a session for users to ask them questions about the project. Reddit and Discord are often used for this.

* **AMM**

Automated Market Maker. That is to say, it is a kind of decentralized exchange platform (DEX). A mathematical formula is used to price assets. In a traditional exchange, it works differently, and assets are priced according to a price algorithm.

* **Arbitrage**

Buying and selling the same asset on two exchanges to take advantage of small price differences.

* **ASIC mining / miner**

ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. This is, in fact, a chip that is specially designed to perform one specific task. For this reason, thanks to ASIC mining, you can mine coins a lot faster than a regular computer or laptop could. For example, for Bitcoin, there are special ASIC miners who are only concerned with solving the SHA-256 algorithm. There are also crypto coins that are impossible to mine with an ASIC.

* **ATH**

ATH means All Time High. This is the highest price a cryptocurrency has ever achieved.

* **Bag**

A bag in the crypto world refers to the coins and tokens that you hold as part of your wallet. Typically, the term is used to describe a significant portion of a particular cryptocurrency. For example, a 'moon bag' is filled with the coins you currently own that you think will make you rich.

* **Bear market**

A bear knocks everything down with its claws. That is why a market where the trend is in a downward movement is called a bear market. Sentiment is then negative and prices predominantly fall.

* **Blockchain**

A blockchain is a kind of digital ledger of transactions that works from a decentralized network. Thanks to cryptography, a ledger can be kept by a large number of computers that together create the network. Every time a new transaction is made, it is added by the miners with date, size, etc. to the blockchain as a new block.

* **Block**

The blocks are the ""pages"" in the digital ledger of the blockchain. These are files with immutable data that are permanently stored on the blockchain.

* **Block reward**

The block reward is the reward that miners receive for finding a mathematical solution related to that block. With Bitcoin, this reward is 25 Bitcoins per mined block. This halves every 210,000 blocks.

* **BTFD**

Buy the f \* cking dip! This term is used when the price of a cryptocurrency or the market is in a dip. People are inclined to leave because they are afraid of losing. But a dip offers opportunities to buy a coin or token cheaply before it starts to rise again.

* **Buy the Dip**

Same as BTFD only without the expletives.

* **Bull market**

A bull stabs its horns and throws you up. That is why a Bull Market is a market where the trend is in an upward movement. Prices are rising and sentiment is positive.

* **Cold storage**

Cryptocurrency is stored “offline”. You do this if you want to safely store coins for a longer period of time. A hardware wallet is an example of cold storage.

* **Cryptography**

Also called secret writing. This focuses on techniques for hiding or encrypting information to be sent so that it is impossible for anyone accessing the channel on which it is sent to find out what information was sent.

* **Cryptocurrency**

A kind of digital currency based on cryptography. This concerns both Bitcoin and other altcoins.

* **DAO**

A DAO is a ""decentralized autonomous organization"" and can be described as an open source blockchain protocol governed by a set of rules, created by its elected members, that automatically perform certain actions without the intervention of intermediaries.

* **dApps**

These are decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or P2P network of computers rather than a single computer, and are beyond the reach and control of a single authority.

* **DeFi - Decentralized Finance**

DeFi, or decentralized financing, is a new way to conduct financial transactions through applications. It excludes traditional financial institutions and intermediaries and is run through the blockchain. Think of it as removing brokers, exchanges, banks and other middlemen from the equation.

* **DEX**

A DEX is a Decentralized Exchange or a decentralized exchange. Decentralized exchanges are a type of cryptocurrency exchange that allows direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions to take place online securely and without an intermediary. No identification is required at these exchanges.

* **Distributed & Central Ledger**

A distributed ledger is an agreement of shareable, shared, and synchronized data, which in this case is spread across several networks. These networks are then distributed over many computers.

With a central ledger, the synchronized and shareable data is controlled by one network or individual.

* **Double Spending**

This means that a particular cryptocoin can be spent more than once. This stops the blockchain from working.

* **Dust Transaction**

A transaction of extremely few coins that represents almost no value, but takes up space on the blockchain.

* **ECDSA**

Elliptic Curve Digitial Signature Algorithm is a lightweight cryptographic algorithm used to sign transactions on the Bitcoin protocol.

* **ERC20 token**

An ERC20 token is in some ways comparable to Bitcoin, Litecoin and any other cryptocurrency; these tokens are assets based on blockchain technology. They have value and you can send and receive them. ERC20 tokens are only issued on the Ethereum network.

* **Escrow**

A concept in which financial assets are held by a third party to protect them during an asynchronous transaction.

* **Fiat money**

Currencies that were once backed by gold (golden standard). Currently it only has value because people value it.

* **FOMO**

""Fear Of Missing Out"". This often occurs when a cryptocurrency increases in value so quickly that people are afraid that they will miss the boat to riches, causing the price per coin to be even higher.

* **FUD**

""Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt"". This crypto term is often used to describe the volatility of the crypto market.

* **Fork (branch / split)**

A fork happens when an alternate operational version of the current blockchain separates permanently. This can be done in three different ways:

* By a 51% attack
* Because there is a bug in the program
* Because new substantial changes have to be made to the current blockchain.
* **Genesis block**

The block mined first in a blockchain

* **Halving**

This means that the minable reward (see block reward) is halved. This happens every time with a certain amount of mined blocks. With Bitcoin, for example, this is for every 210,000 blocks.

* **Hash**

A mathematical process that takes a variable number of data as input and produces a shorter result of a fixed length.

* **Hashrate**

This is the speed at which the math problems for certain blocks can be solved. In other words, the speed at which a new block can be discovered. ASIC mining, for example, causes the hash rate to go down.

* **HODL**

Originally 'Hold' was meant, but in a tipsy mood a chat participant kept talking about how he was 'hodling' his coins. This quickly became a meme and now it has become established in the crypto world and means holding onto your crypto coins for the long term. Sometimes it also refers to 'Hold on for dear life'.

* **ICO**

Stands for Initial Coin Offering. This is a form of crowdfunding, where the public can invest in a blockchain startup in advance. As a thank you for the financial support they are rewarded with a certain amount of coins.

* **IEO**

This is an Initial exchange offer. It is a variant of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), managed directly by cryptocurrency exchanges.

* **KYC**

This stands for 'Know Your Customer'. It refers to the verification process that customers must go through to verify their identity and associate it with a cryptocurrency wallet. Crypto exchanges gain a better understanding of the potential client's activities and can determine whether or not they are legal in nature. A legal requirement for many central exchanges (CEX) to admit customers to their fair.

* **Mining**

Mining is the crypto term used to search for new block rewards. For finding and solving blocks, a reward is given to the miner.

* **Moon**

When a cryptocurrency ""goes to the moon,"" it means people think its price will rise exponentially.

* **Multisig (multiple signatures)**

Multisignature is a form of technology that ensures that extra security is added to Bitcoin transactions. Multisiganature addresses require another user to sign the transaction before it can be added to the blockchain.

* **NFT**

An NFT is a Non-fungible Token. They are unique and cannot be exchanged. They live on the blockchain.

* **Node**

A node is a computer connected to the crypto network that uses a client tasked with validating and tracing transactions. Each node receives a copy of the current blockchain, which is automatically downloaded when it joins the Bitcoin network.

* **P2P**

This stands for peer-to-peer. A (crypto) term that refers to computers that directly build a network with each other without a central server in between.

* **Privacy coin**

These are a class of cryptocurrencies that enable private and anonymous blockchain transactions by obscuring their origin and destination. Some of the techniques used include hiding a user's real wallet balance and address, and combining multiple transactions to circumvent chain analysis. Examples are Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC).

* **Private key**

A string of letters and numbers that is kept secret by the user. It is specially designed to sign a digital transfer using a public key. In the case of Bitcoin, this is a private key that must work with a public key.

* **Public key**

A string of letters and numbers that is public and can be viewed by anyone. This can be used in combination with a private key to sign a digital transaction.

* **Pump and Dump**

This is a crypto term used for the unethical process of pumping and dumping a relatively cheap coin. The coin is first obtained in a very cheap way by a certain group of persons who then ""pump"" the coin (make its value rise sharply) by advertising it a lot. When the coin has appreciated enough, they dump their coins with a lot of profit, leaving a large group at a loss.

* **PoW**

Stands for Proof-of-Work. This is a system that links computing power with mining capacity. The more powerful your computer can mine, the more you will be rewarded for this.

* **PoS**

Stands for Proof-of-Stake. This is a system that links the interest in a particular crypto coin to the mining capacity. This means that the more tokens you own of a particular crypto coin, the more you can mine this coin.

The PoW and the PoS are both consensus algorithms. With this mechanism you can organize as a user, but also machines, in a distributed environment. All agents, the nodes of a blockchain, must agree on a single source of truth. Even if some of the nodes fail. This means that the system must be fault tolerant.

* **DPos**

Stands for Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This is a variant of Proof of Stake that uses supernodes or masternodes to approve transactions.

* **Scam coin**

A coin created for the sole purpose of making the creator of this coin rich (usually through pump and dump).

Often this is accompanied by a Pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme is a business model that recruits members through a promise of payments or services to enroll others in the scheme, rather than providing investment or selling products.

* **SHA-256**

The cryptographic algorithm used for Bitcoin's PoW system.

* **Signature**

A signature is a mathematical process by which someone can prove that he / she is the owner of his / her wallet. For example, a ""private key"" is used.

* **Smart Contract**

A two-way smart contract is an immutable agreement that is recorded on the blockchain, containing specific logical actions that are comparable to a ""normal"" contract. Once this contract has been signed, it can never be changed again. A smart contract can be used to set certain benchmarks that must be met in exchange for money.

* **Wallet**

See ""address""

* **Whale**

A whale is someone or a company that owns a large percentage of a particular crypto coin. It is often the case that a whale can also manipulate the price of this crypto coin.

* **Whitepaper**

* **Yield Farming**

Yield farming, this is also known as liquidity mining. This allows you to generate a way for rewards with cryptocurrency holdings. In simple terms, this means locking cryptocurrencies and receiving rewards. This happens on DeFi projects.

871,The trading algorithm I made can now detect a new coin within 0.3 seconds of it being listed on Binance,4093,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pd9gct/the_trading_algorithm_i_made_can_now_detect_a_new/,935,"It's been about two weeks now since I initially shared with you a tool that I had made in order to quickly buy into a new coin listing to take advantage of the initial surge in the price.

I've spent the past two weeks, debugging, fixing and optimising this code to get it to a level where it actually works. It's been a challenge to test since I have to wait for a new coin order and then check if it broke or not, but I think I finally got there.

Before I go explaining how the tool works, let me explain why I think that this particular strategy has some potential:

As some of you may have noticed, many coins seem to go through to what I would like to call a ""lightning-pump"" during their first few seconds of being listed on an exchange.

Have a look at ICP (you may put your pitchfork down, this chart is the perfect example):

&#x200B;

[chart for ICP](https://preview.redd.it/renmiomwk3k71.png?width=2650&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce6f2eee0528f183fe4cad407affb02ad356546a)

In under a minute, the price of ICP shot up over 10 times, before slowly dipping into the void. Manually trading this 10x would be impossible, due to the speed required to catch this pump.

So I started building a bot that would detect new coin listings in about 20 seconds of them being listed on Binance.

It soon became quite clear that 20 seconds is way too slow to take advantage of the pump so I had to make it quicker.

The second improvement enabled the trading algorithm to find a new coin and place a buy order in about 5 seconds. This was better but not great.

Finally, I decided to remove all the breaks and just call the Binance API like crazy. Full steam ahead.

The bot is now able to detect a new coin listing in 0.3 seconds and place an order. There haven't been any new coins listed after I made this improvement so I will let it run and share my results once I have them.

I've also fixed any bugs that were caught by some of you that decided to test this out so thanks for that!

For anyone interested in trying it out, I've included a test mode that will simulate placing orders so there's no risk involved.

872,“What’s the difference between a coin and a token?” - a quick primer for beginners!,4088,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mn8662/whats_the_difference_between_a_coin_and_a_token_a/,466,"I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mmltsq/why_do_we_have_coins_and_tokens_a_quick_primer/) article yesterday, to explain how a coin comes into play on the blockchain. I later realized that a lot of people may not know the differences between a “coin” and a “token”, so I’m going to explain that here!

Let’s start off with what a blockchain even is! A blockchain is just software that is open source and distributed across many computers. These computers that run the blockchain software are considered “nodes”, and they keep track of the blockchain ledger, and any coins, tokens, and transactions associated with it.

The “coins” on the blockchain are just data (ones and zeroes) that is already written into the software. Using Bitcoin as an example, all 21 million Bitcoins are already in the Bitcoin software, and ownership of these coins is designated through the use of public and private keys, which gives the owners access to their Bitcoin on the blockchain. Also, with each new transaction block that is mined, new Bitcoins are awarded to the miners that processed these blocks. I touched on this whole process in my [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mmltsq/why_do_we_have_coins_and_tokens_a_quick_primer/) post.

In other words, “coins” on a blockchain are just part of the software itself, and are there from it’s inception.

Tokens work a bit differently, in that they’re smart contracts that are deployed onto a blockchain, and are not innate to the blockchain software itself. Using Ethereum as an example, a token (such as an ERC-20 token), is something that a user creates, and deploys onto the blockchain software via smart contracts. When a token is added to the blockchain, the creator of the token is able to write the rules for how a token will work i.e. the max supply, tokenomics, burn rate, functions, etc. All of this is handled in the smart contract portion of it’s creation. Tokens do not have their own blockchain, so they have to abide by the rules of the governing blockchain i.e. Ethereum.

Hopefully this helps to explain the differences between a “coin” and a “token”!",2021-04-09 03:03:37

886,DeFi explained: Smart contracts,4063,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/me9p7h/defi_explained_smart_contracts/,603,"What is a smart contract? How do smart contracts work? And what are they good for? I'll try to answer these questions in this post.

## What are smart contracts?

A smart contract is an agreement between two or more parties in the form of computer code. The contracts are stored on the blockchain and cannot be changed. Transactions that take place in a smart contract are processed by the blockchain, which means they can be sent automatically without the intervention of a third party. When you enter into an agreement with a smart contract, no confidential advisor is required. The transactions only take place if the conditions in the agreement are met.

## What can smart contracts do?

Smart contracts help you exchange money, stock or anything else of value in a transparent, trustless manner, all while avoiding the services of an intermediary and the possibility of conflict. Smart contracts provide you:

* Autonomy - You are the one who makes the deal and you don't have to rely on an intermediary to confirm transactions. The execution is automatically managed by a decentralized network, which excludes manipulation of contracts.
* Speed ​​- Automated contracts can save you hours on manual paperwork.
* Security - Smart contracts are secured with similar cryptography that encrypts websites. In short, it keeps your documents safe.
* Savings - Because they disable the presence of an intermediary, smart contracts can save you a lot of money. Where, for example, you would normally have to pay a notary to witness your transaction, this is now regulated by the blockchain.
* Backup - Unlike files on your computer, data on the blockchain is duplicated many times over. So you do not have to be afraid of losing something that is registered on the blockchain. Also, there is no way anyone can say they lost the contract or the dog ate it.

## A smart contract in effect

As an example; If you were to register cinema tickets on the blockchain using a smart contract, then as a visitor you will receive the tickets in your personal wallet. You only have to show the address to which the tickets were sent upon entry and the cinema can immediately be sure that you do not have any fake tickets and that you have actually paid for your tickets. This gives a better customer experience and the cinema can save a lot of costs in this way because it no longer needs ticket processing services.

## But why is this so safe?

Thanks to blockchain technology, we can decentralize smart contracts so that they are fair and trusted. Decentralization means that they are not controlled by one central party, such as a bank or the government.

The blockchain is a shared database managed by many different computers (nodes). As a result, not one person or company has control over it. It also means that it is almost impossible to hack it and therefore smart contracts can be executed securely and automatically without anyone being able to change them.

## Best practices for smart contracts

In principle, smart contracts can be used for any type of transaction, it does not have to be financial. Here are some industries where smart contracts can be used conveniently.

## Insurances

The insurance world could be shaken up considerably by blockchain technology. An example of a smart contract was a project run by a French insurance company called AXA. AXA offered flight insurance that were paid out if the policyholder's flight was delayed by more than two hours. AXA was running a pilot project that payed out insurance via smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Unfortunately the project has been discontinued.

The smart contract worked with an “if / then function”: IF the flight was delayed by more than two hours, THEN the policyholder would be paid. Because the smart contract was connected to a database that keeps track of flight times, the function could be performed automatically and paid for via the Ethereum blockchain. This would have saved a lot of time for AXA, but also for the policyholder. This is just one example of the many options that smart contracts offer.

## Healthcare

Within healthcare, smart contracts will be used to record and securely transfer data. We can already see examples of smart contracts used in the medical industry, such as the company Encrypgen, for example. This is an application that uses blockchain to transfer patient data in a secure manner, eliminating the need for third-party access. In this way, the patients are in control of their own data. If researchers want to use patient data, they have to pay for it. The patient also chooses whether the data may be sold or not.

## Governments

Governments guarantee that it is extremely difficult to manipulate the voting system, but despite that, smart contracts could alleviate all concerns by providing an infinitely more secure system. Smart contracts could also prevent low voter turnout. Much of the small turnout is due to a clunky system consisting of lining up a queue, showing your identity, and filling out forms. With the use of smart contracts, anyone can transfer their votes securely online, which is expected to generate much more response.

## Business management

There is still a lot of room for improvement within business management and smart contracts can help a lot. Why do administration when everything is registered on the blockchain anyway? Right, the blockchain is already doing the work for you. You also do not have to make a pay slip every month. The money automatically goes to your employees as soon as they have fulfilled the agreements. Companies can simply set up a smart contract that states: IF the date is 10/20/2020, THEN $2500 will be sent to employee A. This means that employees will always be paid on time and that they will never be underpaid. The advantage of the company is that it is all automated, saving them a lot of time and money!

## Fundraising (ICOs)

In principle, anyone could create their own token and sell it to the general public in order to raise money for a project. In 2017 there was a real ICO craze, where some projects managed to raise tens of millions within hours. There was even an EOS ICO that lasted for a year and racked up more than $ 4 billion in total!

If you want to organize an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) you create a token and a contract to sell the token. The function of the smart contract in this case would be: if person A sends an X amount of ETH, person A gets an X amount of tokens.

## Smart contracts in a nutshell

The most important features of a smart contract are:

* Digital Agreement - A smart contract is an agreement in the form of computer code.
* Blockchain - Transactions are processed by a public database, based on blockchain technology.
* Confidentiality - A transaction can only take place if the conditions in the agreement are met.

## Conclusion

It will be a while before smart contracts are everywhere in everyday life, but we can say with some certainty that the technology has a lot to offer.

I hope this post helped you with:

* Getting a better understanding of smart contracts
* Understanding the significance of smart contracts within the crypto space.

888,Here's how Do Kwon cashed out $2.7 billion using Degenbox to drain liquidity out of the LUNA & UST system and into hard money like USDT.,4044,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/v9ypa6/heres_how_do_kwon_cashed_out_27_billion_using/,688,"Credit: [https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1535623662153437185](https://twitter.com/FatManTerra/status/1535623662153437185)

Do kwon was a paper billionaire with no way to cash out without causing a depeg. Heres how he used degenbox to cash out into usdt/usdc

Lets start with what degenbox is: a borrowing protocol where people can loop stablecoin buys. You can stake collateral to buy UST, put it into Anchor, then use your aUST to borrow more UST, put it into Anchor again... You get the drill. It's Anchor on steroids. 

 Terra influencers shilled this strategy en masse, and thousands of retail users began flooding into Degenbox to access the high yields.  This created incredibly thick, near-immovable liquidity near the top of the peg zone (the $0.98 to $1.00 range). In a nutshell, it would allow for someone to cash out billions of UST for MIM at a 1:1 rate without disturbing the peg - all thanks to inorganic demand. 

Here's the total amount of MIM Do Kwon was able to cash out through the MIM/UST pool - without even moving the peg! $2,719,132,772.01, to do with what he pleases. No need to dump LUNA or sell UST on exchanges - he drummed up liquidity from all of you. 

https://preview.redd.it/17acssrn40591.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c39d1c8e03882a24210ee405d9a26e0bb9723184

UST is the future, he said. Decentralized money is sound money, he said. UST won't depeg, he told you. 'Centralized stablecoins will rug you eventually.' So why did he cash out $2.7b from UST into USDT and USDC? Were all those words just lies? (Spoiler: yes.) 

https://preview.redd.it/lnqogfqt40591.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=865f2719dd9ad68966cf5bb029183ad5297ff36d

Here are TFL's outflows. $558m to KuCoin, $1.08b to Binance, $545m to Huobi - you get the gist. Ultimately, all of this money is liquidity being removed from the Terra ecosystem, exacerbating the collapse, bolstering TFL coffers - all while they lied to your face.

Imagine you are trading on margin and get liquidated because the network was down.. this happens in centralised exchanges. Solana now natively brings this kind of user experience to the blockchain where you can experience network failure on the chain. What a wonderful innovation.

Blaming it on attackers is just dishonesty. A well designed blockchain is not supposed to have attackers, its supposed to keep producing blocks based on the parameters of the network, not take a break because someone spammed transactions.

Users are repeatedly questioning the validity of the status dot solana page that shows 100% uptime even when the network was down, and even Coinbase flagged it as down.

TL,dr? Not only did the network go down, as shown by Coinbase status and many complaints on Solana groups, the Solana devs and community managers also tried to suppress whats going on and the Solana status page flat out lies to users.

I would honestly have not bothered going deep into Solana territory, but thanks to the 100 shills who attacked this post, we have all the juicy skeletons coming out of a SOL closet.. what a joke of a database. ",2022-01-04 06:43:59
890,"Brace yourselves: In the coming weeks, crypto markets will explode like you’ve never seen. Here are some essential tips to survive the madness.",4051,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/phxrxy/brace_yourselves_in_the_coming_weeks_crypto/,1729,"
	1. “Hodl” is a meme for suckers.

As prices climb you‘ll start to hear a lot about hodling. [insert 300 and Braveheart meme here]. Just FYI: “Hodl” comes from the early days when folks completely forgot about their Bitcoins until one day they heard on the news that this nerd money passed $1k/coin. They dug out their old wallet (if they were lucky enough to still have access) and thus woke up millionaires.  In short: their inadvertent holding made them exceedingly wealthy. 

The fact is that “hodl” doesn’t mean “never sell” it just means “try not to sell before you’re satisfied.” There’s nothing noble about “never selling” your coins—you tell yourself you’ll hodl through thick and thin—watch the comments like “I’m in cold storage and just grabbing the popcorn” while the market is in free fall.—but that means you have no idea just how cold crypto winter can get.

Your “loyalty” will mean jack-all when your portfolio has gone from $300k to $3k. 

	2. Take the Money and Run:

Set a goal and STICK TO IT. If you’ve made life changing money, or just enough for that goal: a new car, a new computer, college loans, etc.—don’t roll the profits over into the next coin poised to explode —  just take the money and run. Do what you planned to with it, celebrate, and enjoy your success (no matter what that success looks like). The bear will come and you can buy back in.

Greed is a bottomless pit and always chasing “a little bit more” will never make you happy. Remember that meme of the dude at the party standing in the corner while everyone else is having fun: “They dont know i have ETH.” 

News flash: yes they do. But even so, living is way more important than hodling—and the people dancing, having a genuinely good time living life, are in a way better position than the guy in the corner with his ETH.

	3. You don’t start spending the money until you’ve lost the money.

I remember the first time I experienced my portfolio climbing $5k/$10k per day. It was insanity. All of a sudden money became cheap. Easy to throw away, easy to take for granted. Amounts of money that I had never dreamed could have become accessible to me had suddenly become nothing more than crumbs. 

It wasn’t until the proceeding bear market—when it had ‘dip’-by-‘dip’ fizzled to almost nothing did I start to think about what I could have spent all that cash on. I had tried so hard to maximize my gains that I was afraid to sell anything—lest my portfolio grow less exponentially than it otherwise would have. 

So many moments in the proceeding bear market where I tormented myself with questions: “why didn’t I at least buy a nice car?” Or “I could have sold enough for a house and still have more in my portfolio than I currently have”, or “Man I could have bought so much ETH now if I had sold back then.” 

A lot of regret made me fall out of love with “hodl”.

    4.  The bull market does come to an end.

Yes yes—institutions, mainstream, celebrities, El Salvador, PayPal, etc. Blah blah blah.

Remember: the “institutions” make money when the market goes up and they make more money when the market goes down. Governments are corrupt and will pass and nullify laws for their benefit. 

The bull run will absolutely come to an an end—and while no one knows when “THE” bull ends, you can very much know when YOUR bull ends: when you’ve hit your goal.

Brace yourselves, and God Speed.",2021-09-04 19:16:49
891,"As a Security Analyst here are some tips I’ve learned from my line of work to keep you, your computer, and your crypto safe.",4043,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mv3bqe/as_a_security_analyst_here_are_some_tips_ive/,677,"I currently work within a fortune 100 company’s Computer Security Incident Response Team as a security analyst. 

As more and more newbies jump in the field, I wanted to share some security tips outside the typical “not your keys, not your wallet” type security as there’s other ways to be hit

1.) [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) enter your email and see what data breaches your email(s) have been apart of. I recently helped a fellow reddit user who said his account was hacked, turns out he was part of a breach where a crypto site was hacked and his password was exposed, he reused this password on another crypto site that the attacker crossed referenced with his email / pass from the other site and didn’t have 2FA activated.

With that don’t reuse passwords, and use auto generated passwords / store them in a encrypted password manager (I use [KeePass](https://keepass.info/))

2.) Every single program/software is essentially a attack vector, keep your OS updated, keep your software updated, and uninstall ANY thing you don’t use anymore. Just look up the SolarWinds hack and see how supply chain attacks work.

3.) Don’t download random stuff from this site or any other. If you want to, check the hash of the software. This can be done using “Certutil -hashfile ‘filename’ sha256” in the windows cmd (Linux you can use “sha256sum ‘filename’”) you can then enter the hash into [VirusTotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/search) to see if it comes back malicious.

4.) Keeping your seed phrase safe, I personally store it in a KeePass database file (encrypted) then put that file on 2 USB drives and store it in 2 different secure locations.

5.) typical advice: Don’t engage reddit messages, don’t disclose your portfolio, cold wallets, and activate 2FA on your reddit account to keep your moons safe.

EDIT: 

6.) Don’t trust email links, I’ve actually worked with the owner of haveibeenpwned owned on a “breach” I found where I found over 12K emails that were entered into phishing sites, and reported it to him. Always go to the site directly through the url address (and double check it)

7.) ALSO! Forgot one of the most important ones, chrome extensions, these can have keyloggers, take screenshots, and track you. It might not be malicious when you downloaded it, but attackers generally 
 update them with malicious code with those capabilities or aren’t updated at all which leads to potential unfixed vulnerabilities. Double check the ones you have installed, and remove any you don’t need.

8.) VPN / Browser, use a vpn with a no log policy to encrypt your network traffic. I personally use ProtonVPN and it’s worth the few bucks a month for a paid version, brave also allows you to use TOR in browser. Another option is hardening Firefox to use as a browser if brave doesn’t suite your needs which a guide can be found [here](https://informinc.org/internet/how-to-harden-your-firefox-browser-for-security-and-privacy/)

EDIT EDIT:
I’ve gotten a lot of messages regarding how to get into the Cybersecurity field and trying my best to respond to them, if there’s interest I could make a post about that at some point. 

If so please feel free to leave questions below, that you would like answered in case it doesn’t come to mind when writing it / trying my best to respond.",2021-04-20 23:29:23

From what I see this is happening now : 

1. CMC removed Korean exchanges
2. Prices/graphs instantly tanked (but in practice not relevant to people outside Korea who dont trade there anyhow)
3. Large number of people did not recognize what actually happened and that there were not moves/selling on their western exchanges
4. Those same people are now dumping large amount of coins trying to ""cut loses"" because of the false impression that coin is crashing.
5. Random stuff happening

My opinion is that this should have been handled much better by CMC. At least put a banner saying ""WE HAVE EXCLUDED KOREAN EXCHANGES BECAUSE OF THIS OR THAT AND IT WILL HAVE SUCH INFLUENCE ON CALCULATIONS"". I just hope they do not put back and remove those exchanges at random point in time. Any thoughts?",2018-01-08 09:46:46
894,Why is everyone so sure that crypto will always bounce back strong at some point?,4045,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s7l623/why_is_everyone_so_sure_that_crypto_will_always/,3590,"This isn't fud or anything.  I actually have most of my money in crypto so I make posts like these somewhat in part for my own sanity too and the discussions on these topics.

I notice a lot of smart people who analyze the market seem to think there's always a strong likelihood of reaching new highs in the future. 

IE- the market may go down a lot and reach bear markets but somehow it will bounce back and eventually reach new all time highs at some point for bitcoin, etherium and others. 

I'm curious to ask here- how confident are you that crypto will continue to do this and why?

Bitcoin is the daddy of crypto and is the most likely to be around in 5-10 years but ETH and ADA have smaller market caps so more room to grow.

I would personally choose ETH as it can still 2x or 3x in the next few years whereas BTC may not even 2x.

902,"I stopped reading whitepapers. Not because I'm a lazy noob, but because I'm humble enough to recognize I won't be able to understand a lot of what they say.",4024,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mgzdxw/i_stopped_reading_whitepapers_not_because_im_a/,593,"Probably gonna get downvoted to oblivion, so you could consider this reverse moon farming. Anyways, before anybody discredits me, I am studying Computer Science and have been able to land some nice internships, so yes, I admit that I'm not an expert and there are many things I don't know, however I would consider myself someone that has been exposed to basic Computer Science concepts, and more advanced ones in Algorithms, Data Structures and Cryptography.

With that out of the way, I just wanted to say that there are a lot of people here giving recommendations to new people (which is great) and there is this specific one that really irks me, ""Read the whitepaper"". Why does it annoy me so much?

* Well, for starters I highly doubt that people giving these recommendations even read the whitepapers themselves, I honestly believe that they say this in order to look like ""responsible investors"" or ""being in it for the tech"", whatever their motives are, I believe that 99% are lying.
* For the tiny minority that actually reads the whitepapers, I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but I highly doubt you understand the important technical part of the whitepapers completely. I say this because I've taken several high level CS courses in college and I struggle every time to grasp some concepts that describe how a certain project works and what makes it significant. I am certainly no guru, but I believe that I know more CS than the vast majority of people who are trying to get into crypto, and if someone like me can't understand what these whitepapers say, how exactly will a newcomer get any benefit from trying to read these documents?

You know, I remember I got into crypto right when I started college, and even now 3 years later, I prefer just watching a simplified video about a project than trying to read the whitepaper, which I know will be a waste of time. There is a reason why most projects upload a simplified version that explains how the project works, and that's so that newcomers can get an idea of what the project is. Odds are that the vast majority of people trying to buy a certain cryptocurrency will be people that just don't have the background required to understand whitepapers, so let's stop recommending them to read whitepapers and instead recommend them something different, like watching videos or reading simplified articles that explain what the cryptocurrency that they want to buy is.",2021-03-31 05:56:30

905,Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency was invented in the first place.,3988,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nlu2fu/just_a_quick_reminder_why_bitcoincryptocurrency/,697," 

* People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.
* Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.
* Banks  gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran  “fractional reserves”. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks  collapsed because of runs on the bank.
* Central  banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort.  Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other’s  deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered.  Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all,  banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.
* Banks  would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient  trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments  would have to step in to save them.
* All  ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when  Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed  amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now  effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks  could create.
* From  this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be  supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and  lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to  them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But  these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And  reserves are much lower than the loans they make.
* This  led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped  reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in  the supply of the euro of about 5%.
* This  leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat  lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of  increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper  all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices  to drop every year. That they don’t is the effect of money creation.
* What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.
* Banks  have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase +  2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish  this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting  this money returned to them at an interest.
* Apart  from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every  couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or  the system will collapse.
* Apart  from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away  with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to  exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to  transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.
* The  absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were  force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and  silver remain difficult to use.
* When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals  (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined  the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only  thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of  failure.
* What  was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what  Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the  problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with  the text: “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for  banks.”. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial  system.

So, if you find  yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency’s price, or bogged  down in discussions about the “one true bitcoin”, or constantly asking  what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.

We are here to fix the financial system.",2021-05-26 23:10:03
