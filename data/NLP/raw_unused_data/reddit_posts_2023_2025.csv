SPX / Bitcoin New Interesting Trading Level,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1jwxb4f/spx_bitcoin_new_interesting_trading_level/,1,"A few years ago, I pulled up the chart SPX/(BTC/100), which gives me the value of the S&P 500 index priced per one million sats. I drew a line at the valuation's bottom at 6.38 million sats per SPX. When Bitcoin pumped late last fall/ earlier winter, the S&P fell bellow the 6.38 million sats level, but then something interesting happened. This level, which I doubted anyone else was watching, became resistance. Recently, however, as Bitcoin dumped, the level has become support for SPX. I am surprised to see this because I figured not many people are watching SPX denominated in Bitcoin, but maybe I am wrong. 

You can find the charts here:

I Built an AI to Signal Crypto Futures Trades—Here's How the First Trade Went!,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1jt1ujh/i_built_an_ai_to_signal_crypto_futures/,11,"Hey r/BitcoinMarkets 

Just wanted to share something cool I've been working on. I built an AI-powered signal for crypto futures trading. The idea was simple: tap into the incredible intelligence of advanced LLM models and let them guide my crypto trades. I've been feeding these models tons of crypto data, fine-tuning them specifically for market moves. To avoid bias from any single model, I'm actually using multiple cutting-edge LLMs and combining their predictions into one solid trading signal. All process are systematic.

Why crypto futures? Honestly, mainly because shorting is straightforward, making it easier to act quickly on signals.

Here's a debut signal I put out yesterday—check it out if you're curious: [https://henryzhang.substack.com/p/btc-crypto-futures-trading-signal](https://henryzhang.substack.com/p/btc-crypto-futures-trading-signal)

It accurately called a short on Bitcoin with exact entry, stop-loss, and take-profit points. I took the trade, and it turned out nicely. Of course, it's still early days, and whether there's consistent alpha here will take more testing and validation. Just thought I'd share what I'm up to and maybe get your thoughts!

Cheers!

Over the past 7 weeks since s and p high Feb 19 bitcoin has dropped 13% and been unable to rise back anywhere near its Feb 19 value same as the market struggling to regain its peak. As opposed to gold price which has continued rising.

Looking back at 2022 bear market I see that was a brutal year for bitcoin.

I’m a big bitcoin believer and have a good chuck of my brokerage in IBIT. I’ve been waiting for bitcoin to show it can diverge from the US market like gold but I haven’t seen any evidence of it. And now I have some concern how low it could go and how long it may stay depressed if we are entering a bear market.

I forget exact data but I think around 15-25% of bitcoin is held by US/canadian investors. So vast majority is global investors. That gives me some hope it can diverge. But the positive news of US institutional adoption may be mitigated by US economy crashing, and EU and other key countries haven’t seemed to show much adoption of it yet, right?

I think it’s 50-50 on which way it moves next 6 months if US is indeed entering a bear market. Would love to get other’s thoughts or points I’m overlooking.",2025-03-31 22:27:15

"[BTC] Morning Order Book Update — March 24, 2025 | Key Walls, Manual Sells & Q1 Close",28,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1jimxes/btc_morning_order_book_update_march_24_2025_key/,9,"
Price: $87,350 
Volume up, CVD +3371 — buyers are in control, stacking pressure near resistance.


⸻

Sell-Side Liquidity:

	•	88,000 — 172 BTC
	•	87,800 — 94 BTC
	•	87,600 — 105 BTC

→ The 87,500–88,000 range is our “red zone” from the chart.

It’s playing out perfectly — but here’s the twist:
We’re not just seeing limit walls. Manual sell orders are being placed aggressively — likely from fund bots trying to cap price and harvest liquidity.

⸻

Buy-Side Liquidity:

	•	86,000 — 1,124 BTC (massive wall)
	•	85,500 — 466 BTC
	•	85,200–84,600 — 100–150 BTC per level

→ Total visible buy-side liquidity: 2,100+ BTC.

Big hands are clearly accumulating.

⸻

What’s Next?

Break above 88K = door opens straight into 92K–94K liquidity zone.
We can already see signs of absorption and potential magnet action toward that level.

⸻

Bonus Context:

We’re approaching Q1 and monthly close.
Funds often want green candles on the chart for investor reports — and that typically means a bullish quarterly finish.

⸻

Grizzly’s short note:

	•	Strong buy wall at 86K — price well protected below
	•	Red zone at 88K acting as friction point — but it’s artificial
	•	Breakout could trigger a fast move to 92–94K
	•	Quarterly close fuel might push us higher

⸻

Sip your coffee, study the walls.

"Morning Bitcoin Order Book Check with Your Coffee – March 22, 2025",35,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1jh5e36/morning_bitcoin_order_book_check_with_your_coffee/,5,"
Let’s dive into the BTC order book while you sip your morning coffee.

Current price range:
We’re sitting between $84,000 – $85,800, and it’s clear this zone is packed with action.

⸻

Order Book Heatmap – Key Levels

Resistance (limit sell walls):

	•	85,800 – 441 BTC
	•	85,700 – 428 BTC
	•	85,600 – 463 BTC
	•	85,500 – 447 BTC

The upper zone is loaded with sell orders. Someone really doesn’t want price to break above — most likely institutional players or funds placing thick walls to keep things capped for now.

Support (limit buy walls):

	•	84,200 – 1,180 BTC
	•	84,300 – 773 BTC
	•	84,000 – ~800 BTC

This is some serious buy-side pressure. These walls look like accumulation zones — big players are scooping up BTC and not letting it fall below this range.

⸻

Trade Flow (T&S):

Most trading activity is concentrated between 84,200 – 84,500 right now.
Lots of small market orders (5–10 BTC) going through — shows a calm but confident market, without panic.

⸻

Market Sentiment:

	•	Order book volume up +23%
	•	Overall supply down -9%

This hints at sell-side orders being slightly pulled back while buyers are stepping in more aggressively. Could be a sign of quiet accumulation.

⸻

TL;DR:

	•	Strong support wall at 84,200

	•	Thick resistance zone up to 85,800

	•	A breakout from either side could trigger a sharp move —
Shorts might get squeezed above, weak longs might panic below.

For now, it looks like the whales are still playing tug-of-war, keeping price in this tight zone over the weekend. I expect we stay here until some fresh news or catalyst hits the market.

⸻

Stay caffeinated. Stay patient.

"Bitcoin Order Book Update – Morning Coffee Edition  | March 21, 2025",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1jgd982/bitcoin_order_book_update_morning_coffee_edition/,1,"
Looking at the order book, we can see that we are still ranging between two key zones. This means institutions are still holding this area for position accumulation.

📊 Liquidity Breakdown

🔹 Buy Orders (Bids):

	•	$83,600 – $84,000: 930 BTC in limit buy orders.
	•	$84,000 – $84,250: 650 BTC in buy orders.
	•	Below $83,500: Huge liquidity reserves, but no visible cluster of orders.

🔻 Sell Orders (Asks):

	•	$84,800 – $85,000: 1,050 BTC in sell orders.
	•	$85,500: 1,350 BTC, a high concentration of liquidity, possibly market makers positioning.
	•	$86,500 – $88,000: A large amount of stop liquidity is placed. If broken, we can expect a strong impulse move, which I’ve been waiting for all this time. Those stops are still untouched.

⚡ Futures Market & Potential Short Squeeze

	•	Open Interest at $84,250: More than 5,000 BTC held in positions.
	•	Key Liquidity Cluster still above $85,000 → a possible short squeeze scenario.
	•	Balance is shifting towards limit buyers in the $83,600 – $84,000 range.
	•	$84,800 has a large number of sell orders, but market participants may pull them at any moment.

📈 Summary:

✅ $83,600 – $84,000 → Strong Buy Zone (institutional accumulation).

✅ $84,800 – $85,500 → Sell Zone, where liquidity may be collected before a move higher.

✅ $86,500 – $88,000 → Liquidity grab zone, where stops could trigger a squeeze and push us even higher.

📌 As always, manage your risk. Bitcoin remains bullish as long as we trade within this range. Only major news could push us out of this accumulation channel. If we hold this momentum, institutions will likely shift their accumulation zone higher from the current range.

🚀 Stay sharp, the move is coming!",2025-03-21 09:59:14

"Bitcoin Morning Update with your coffee | March 20, 2025",30,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1jfmgsy/bitcoin_morning_update_with_your_coffee_march_20/,10,"
Good morning, friends! Hope you’re enjoying your coffee because today’s Bitcoin price action has been nothing short of intense. Let’s break it down.

📉 What Just Happened?
	•	A sudden drop in BTC price was triggered by a market sell-off of ~900 BTC.

	•	The order book reacted instantly, with major buy support at $85,000 absorbing the sell-off.

	•	Currently, $85,000 has the largest buy wall (~1,500 BTC), and it’s constantly refreshing – likely managed by algo traders and fundamental buyers.

📊 Key Order Book Zones & Market Trend

🔹 Support at $85,000 – strong defense level, keeping BTC in a new range of $85,000 – $86,000.

🔹 Sell wall at $86,000 – this could slow any immediate upside move, leading to further accumulation.

🔹 Liquidity target at $89,000 – yesterday, we failed to reach it, but it remains a key target. BTC might push higher to sweep this level.

📈 Trend & Market Outlook

	•	Bitcoin remains bullish despite this shakeout.
	•	The price action is still inside an ascending channel, meaning the broader trend has not broken.
	•	Sharp liquidations like today are normal in an uptrend, as they are often orchestrated by market makers before the next move up.

🚀 Conclusion: The Uptrend is Intact!

🔸 BTC is still bullish.

🔸 Watch $85K support and $86K resistance – a break above could push us towards $89K.

🔸 Trade smart, stay patient, and let liquidity guide the way.

💰 Wishing you all a profitable day – stay disciplined, and good luck! 🚀",2025-03-20 11:13:57

"Bitcoin Order Book Update – Morning Coffee Edition | March 19, 2025",53,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1jeuc6z/bitcoin_order_book_update_morning_coffee_edition/,7,"

Good morning, traders! 🌞 Today is shaping up to be a high-volatility day with the FOMC meeting scheduled. Expect major liquidity sweeps and potential stop-hunts. If you’re trading, be cautious – avoid unnecessary risks!

🔍 Key Support & Resistance Levels (Order Book Analysis)

🔹 Support Levels (Buy Walls):

	•	$82,500 – $82,000: Around 2,000 BTC in buy orders stacked here.

	•	$81,500: Possible deep liquidity sweep zone before any recovery.

🔹 Resistance Levels (Sell Walls):

	•	$83,500 – $84,500: Roughly 2,000 BTC in sell orders. Strong resistance zone.

	•	$85,000: If broken, the market could quickly spike.

	•	🚨 $89,000: A new major sell wall (~2,000 BTC) has appeared here, which was not previously present. This suggests that if BTC breaks $85,000, we could see a massive squeeze straight to $89K to clear these orders.

🔥 What Does This Mean?
	•	Liquidity Grab Likely: Market makers might sweep liquidity from $80K and $89K before establishing direction.
	•	Limited Downside Support: There’s not much buy-side protection below $82K, meaning price could be more volatile on dips.

🎯 Trading Strategy for Today

	•	Best plays: Look for entries around $82,000–$81,500 and target $84,000–$85,000.

	•	Avoid FOMO trades: Whales and institutions are trapping price in a range and accumulating positions.

	•	Stay disciplined: Today is not the day for reckless risk-taking. Expect heavy wicks and stop-runs!

💰 Bitcoin is strength. Blockchain is the future. Stay safe & trade wisely! 🚀",2025-03-19 11:01:02

📢 Morning Bitcoin Update with Your Coffee ☕️ 18 March 2025,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1je2esh/morning_bitcoin_update_with_your_coffee_18_march/,0,"**

📢 Morning Bitcoin Update with Your Coffee ☕️

Good morning, everyone! 🌞

Bitcoin remains trapped in the grip of institutional funds – support at $82,500–$82,400, while sell orders keep piling up around $83,000. No major moves yet, as big players continue accumulating positions at these levels, preventing the price from breaking out in either direction.

🔥 The key event ahead? The FOMC meeting on March 19, which will likely dictate Bitcoin’s next major move. Until then, expect sideways action and potential manipulations.

💥 Recent whale action – a $330M short position:
	•	A group of traders attempted a short squeeze, but at $85,100, the whale added margin, pushing liquidation further away.
	•	He eventually closed his position with an $8-9M profit and is no longer in the trade.

What’s next?

🔹 Expect sideways movement in the $82,000–$84,000 range.

🔹 If we break $83,500, the range could shift to $85,000–$86,000.

🔹 Keep an eye on $82,000 – if support disappears, we might see a deeper retrace.

This is a range-bound market, so trade accordingly, stick to discipline, and manage your risk!

💰 Wishing you all a profitable day! 🚀",2025-03-18 11:07:20

☕ Morning Bitcoin Market Update – Grab Your Coffee & Let’s Dive In!,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1jd8v5z/morning_bitcoin_market_update_grab_your_coffee/,9,"

17 March 2025 AM

https://ru.tradingview.com/chart/1CneWjKu/

Bitcoin is following technical levels perfectly, and today’s order book confirms strong liquidity zones.

📌 Key Observation:
For those watching TradingView, we bounced perfectly from the $82,000 buyer zone—a bookmap reaction. I personally entered a position there and will now watch for further reactions at key levels.

⸻

📉 Order Book Breakdown (Bookmap Analysis):

🔹 Buy Orders (Support Zones):

✅ $83,000 – $83,200 → ~700 BTC buy orders

✅ $82,500 – $82,800 → ~1,000 BTC buy orders

✅ $82,000 → Strongest buyer wall, ~1,500 BTC

🔹 Sell Orders (Resistance Zones):

🚩 $85,000 → The “mystical zone” of major resistance

🚩 $85,200 → The liquidation point of a massive short position (previously spotted in an earlier post!)

🚩 $87,000 → Strong sell-side liquidity—this is where price could squeeze today

⸻

⚡ Market Outlook & Trade Plan:

	•	If BTC holds above $83,000, a retest of $85,000 – $85,200 seems likely.

	•	Above $85,200, we should see a short squeeze towards $87,000, triggering stop hunts.

	•	Watching for reactions at $85K—if the level gets absorbed, we’re pushing higher.

⸻

⚡ Quick Bitcoin Order Book & Market Analysis with Your Morning Coffee ☕ 15 March 2025,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1jbrono/quick_bitcoin_order_book_market_analysis_with/,1,"Bitcoin is currently moving between two liquidity zones. Yesterday, we cleared the strong seller wall at $84,500, meaning this resistance no longer exists.

Now, we can see that institutional buyers have set up strong buy walls over the weekend, indicating a potential accumulation phase before the next move.

⸻

📉 Order Book & Key Liquidity Zones

🔹 Support Zones (Buy Orders):

✅ $83,000 – $83,200 → ~700 BTC in buy orders

✅ $82,500 – $82,800 → ~1,000 BTC in buy orders

✅ $81,500 – $81,800 → ~1,500 BTC in buy orders (largest buy wall)

💡 These are likely set by institutional players, not retail traders’ limit orders.

🔹 Resistance Zones (Sell Orders):

🚩 $87,500 → Massive sell wall with ~1,500 BTC

🚩 $88,000 → More than 1,000 BTC in short stop-loss orders

📌 Potential scenario:

If Bitcoin bounces from strong support zones, it will likely squeeze liquidity from short sellers at $87,000+ and possibly spike through $88,000 to clear stop losses.

⸻

📊 Trading Plan for Today

🎯 Strategy:

	•	Entering a short-term long from $83,500 – $82,500
	•	Targeting $87,000 – $88,000
	•	Exiting with a limit order, since a wick and sharp retracement are likely in that range

💡 Be cautious: Institutional players have set a “trap” around Bitcoin, holding it in their controlled liquidity zones. Weekends are highly manipulative—either range-bound or suddenly spiking up/down to liquidate both sides.

⸻

📢 Final Thoughts

In my opinion, Bitcoin remains bullish for now. However, expect potential market manipulation over the weekend.

Wishing everyone a great day, solid profits, and a strong cup of coffee! ☕🚀
And remember—never stop believing in Bitcoin and financial independence! 💪🔥

Morning Bitcoin order book update with your coffee,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1jb0p3p/morning_bitcoin_order_book_update_with_your_coffee/,11,"
Bitcoin continues to move within a medium-term uptrend. We still haven’t reached a proper retest of the lower channel boundary or the trendline.

📊 RSI is sitting at 44, which is a neutral zone, meaning there is no clear directional bias yet. Bitcoin’s price is still being tested against macroeconomic conditions and political factors.

⸻

📉 Order Book & Liquidity Zones:

🔹 Key Support Zones:

✅ $81,800 – $82,000 → Strong buy-side liquidity with over 1,200 BTC in limit orders

✅ $80,500 → Large buy interest with significant limit orders

🔹 Key Resistance Zones:

🚩 $83,200 – $83,500 → ~850 BTC in sell orders

🚩 $84,500 → A major sell wall with ~1,100 BTC

🚩 $87,000 → Massive resistance with ~1,500 BTC in limit sell orders

⸻

🔥 Summary & Key Levels to Watch:

	•	$82,000 is confirmed as strong support, while $84,500 remains the key barrier for upside movement.

	•	If BTC breaks above $84,500, this will confirm an uptrend continuation, likely triggering a spike straight to $87,000.

	•	If BTC breaks below $81,800, we could see a retest of the lower trendline around $76,000 (though this scenario seems less likely for now).

⸻

🎯 Trading Strategy for Today:

📌 If you’re looking for entry zones:

	•	For long-term accumulation: $80,500 – $81,000 looks like the best area to catch a bounce.

	•	For short-term speculation: A breakout above $84,500 could lead to a rapid push toward $87,000.

I’ll be closely monitoring the order book and news flow—if anything changes, I’ll provide timely updates.

💪 Stay strong, we are in this together! Wishing you all a great trading day! 🚀

Quick BTC order book update with your morning coffee,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1j9h99h/quick_btc_order_book_update_with_your_morning/,4,"
Right now, strong buyer volume is concentrated around the support zone at $80,800–$82,000, providing a solid floor. Above our current price (~$82,400), local sellers are stacked between ~$82,800–$83,000, with more significant resistance around $84,000–$84,500.

https://ru.tradingview.com/chart/1CneWjKu/

Here’s the detailed breakdown of key levels from today’s order book:
	•	Strong Support: $80,800–$82,000 (heavy buyer orders)
	•	Immediate Resistance: ~$82,800–83,000 (minor), then stronger at $84,000–$84,500
	•	If we break above $84,500, the road opens towards $87,200 and further up to the $90,500–92,000 zone (Ichimoku Cloud and Fib levels).

Bottom line: Expect decent volatility between $80,800 and $84,500, but the support below is solid. Staying bullish as long as support holds!

Keep the vibes bullish, stay positive, LONG only!
Have a profitable day, everyone!

Saylor is the problem,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1j8hcxt/saylor_is_the_problem/,37,"Bitcoin is fine. It works as it shouled, holds up its original promise.

But Saylor created his own Ponzi scheme. He bought insane amounts on credit and now wants to concince everyone to buy more. Obviously this doesn’t have anything to do with the original idea of Bitcoin.

Obviously bitcoin is volatile. His average at 66k is horrible keeping in mind the sheer amount he‘s holding. Hodlers would say ""the Price doesn’t matter“, but it does, when you bought your bitcoin on credit and have to pay back + interest. Saylor might be forced to sell off, also through all his Investors, then we will into a crash never seen before. 

It’s not even about how likely this is to happen, it’s about the idea of saylor‘s House of cards that makes everyone loose trust in the value of bitcoin. 

I think in the long term the crash is needed. Saylor must get forced out. Goverment reserves are one thing, still kinda against the original idea, but fine if they are limited in their scale and influence, but what saylor tries to do is literally a snowball play on unstable ground. Get this grifter out. This will hurt a lot Short Term, especially newer bitcoiners, but I think it’s necessary to save is all in the long run.",2025-03-11 03:12:04

Yesterday I made a post that bitcoin was going to make a correction,  for those who are new, a market correction is normally considered a 10% drop. From my research that placed btc at 76,500k , so yes we are in a stage of correction. And possibly the biggest market crash since covid comming. You can believe what you want and have your own oppinions,  but there has been many major influences in the stock market and crypto communities talking about this biggest crash for sometime. As with the covid crash everything will pick back up. This could continue for the next 8 to 12 months. So just stick it out and wait ✋️.  ",2025-03-09 22:14:26

Will there be some bullish tweets surrounding it? Maybe, but imo people are now expecting something more than what it is.

Bitcoin and Macroeconomics,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ixkubo/bitcoin_and_macroeconomics/,2,"Hey everyone, I’ve been a long-term Bitcoin investor and have largely met my return goals by holding. However, after diving deeper into macroeconomics, I believe Bitcoin’s price is heavily influenced by broader economic trends. In the next 6–12 months, I expect economic conditions to deteriorate, with the Fed’s response—especially to inflation and labor market data—determining whether we enter a bull or bear market.

That said, I have two reasons for not selling my Bitcoin:

	1.	A potential federal Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) announcement under a Trump administration, which could drive prices up.
	2.	If inflation stays below 3%, tightening liquidity may push the Fed to ease QT, supporting asset prices.

Given this outlook, would it make sense to hedge with S&P 500 put options expiring in Q4 2025, or would that be too risky? Curious to hear your thoughts!",2025-02-25 02:57:45

My estimate was off by 12 days, price stagnated a lot and moved slower than I expected, but we finally got there.

Final retest of the range bottom, $90700.

My Buy Orders filled today at $91,700 (I set them a little above $90,700 in-case we didn't hit the range low, didn't want it to re-trace to $109,000 without me).

Might see some chop over the next day or two.

But hopefully we can still close February at $120,000. Might be tight to get up that high within 3 days, so more likely for Monday or Tuesday of next week (March 3-4).",2025-02-25 01:36:22

Why Has not BTC Tanked Since the Bybit Hack Surfaced?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1iw2e2k/why_has_not_btc_tanked_since_the_bybit_hack/,11,"I was hoping bitcoin will drop through the 80,000 floor. But did not happen. 

The buybit hack gave some credence to every voice beating the old drum that crypto is a scam, obviously. But seems did not result in a BTC sell off? Why? 

Or is it like the market has not reacted yet, I.e. too soon for the market to price in? ",2025-02-23 04:56:41
Anyone here a Crypto CPA?,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ivp3si/anyone_here_a_crypto_cpa/,2,"Hi,

I wanted to ask if anyone has any suggestions or advice for a new student or someone interested in pursuing this career?  Any advice or suggestions or tips?  I know literally nothing about the connect between them both.

  
But I'm pursuing a Bachelors of International Accounting and Business major and have some minor Bitcoin, Mining and Blockchain experience from 12-13 years ago.

  
Been reading about the SHITTY WLB around Public Accountants and CPAs.  Wondered if it's the same for Crypto CPAs.

Or if it's better pay and better WLB?

How Much Political Opinions & Political Discussion Should Be Allowed in The Daily Threads?,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ivow3j/how_much_political_opinions_political_discussion/,40,"Until recently, this subreddit was mostly politics-free.

But, as Governments and Politicians around the world begin to pay more attention to Bitcoin, political discussion in our Daily Threads has become more and more common and is occasionally getting out of hand and generating a lot of reports to the moderators.

[Example of a comment thread that inspired me to create this poll.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ivb2ts/comment/me4t91z/)

Sometimes this discussion is related to Bitcoin public policy (proposed or passed laws, bitcoin-related government policies, etc), sometimes it is 1% about Bitcoin and 99% the poster's unrelated political opinions, often it is completely unrelated to Bitcoin and devolves into bickering and name calling that generates a lot of reports and work for the mod team.

I'm curious what YOU want to see.

Options:

1. **Bitcoin-related public policy, NOT politics:** You want to see news, discussion, and debate around how Bitcoin-related public policy and laws may impact the Bitcoin price (ex: Strategic Bitcoin Reserves, SAB121, court cases, any policies or laws that may affect Bitcoin) but you **DO NOT** want to see users injecting their opinions on politics or specific politicians into the discussion because it often derails the conversation.
2. **Political Discussion is fine, even if barely related to Bitcoin, as long as it doesn't violate Rule #1:** You don't mind if people are discussing or debating politics in the Daily Threads, as long as it starts off related to Bitcoin, even if it devolves into non-Bitcoin related discussion, and everyone is being respectful to their fellow traders.
3. **I'm here for TA and charts only! I don't care about Governments' Bitcoin policies nor politics:** You're a TA-only type of trader that believes news and what governments do doesn't move markets. You don't want to see any discussion about government policies, laws, politicians, or politics in the Daily Threads. Charts, lines, and astrology for men ONLY!
4. **I love politics and debating about it with anyone and everyone!** You are obsessed with politics. You spend your days on r/politics and wish every subreddit was a place where you could debate politics and argue about politicians all day long.
5. **Something Else (that I posted below):** You have a different idea of how the mods should approach political discussion that you have posted below as a reply.

This poll will close in 7 days.

Disclaimer: There is absolutely zero guarantee the results of this poll will influence any moderator decisions, I'm mainly curious what YOU want to see in the Daily Threads. **As always, all subreddit rules apply, especially rules #1 and #2.** Keep hitting the report button for any content that violates any rules in the sidebar.

It’s been few years that I trade only Btc but in the sideways days like these it’s really hard to get a good trades. 
As my coach says sometimes taking no trade is trading too I’m a patient guy but I really want to trade silver, gold, fx at the same time in the same platform. 
Currently I’m using bybit, the interface is amazing for me especially while leverage trading. 

So, my question is, is there ant trading platform that I can fx, gold, silver and Btc at the same time? 
I want to use same platform for just to make my money stacked because of controlling the liquidation price… 
I remember back in the days they were currency.com I suppose, need recommendations.

Wondering where to go/who to talk to about making a crypto medium of exchange,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1iopeyn/wondering_where_to_gowho_to_talk_to_about_making/,42,"I’ve had a concept of a stable medium of exchange for a while and would want to make it a reality. I just have no idea who to talk to and where to look in terms of making it. And would also like some feedback and criticism on my concept. If anyone has any advice to provide that would be greatly appreciated

Edit: I'll add a description of the medium of exchange below...

The concept surrounds balancing out 3 different extremes that apply to all currencies used in society. Equality/Equity (tax rate), Centralization/Decentralization (tax allocation), and Inflation/Decentralization (supply-demand).

I approach it using a 3D graph (x: tax rate, y: tax allocation, z: supply-demand). Once doing this, you see that the X-axis extremes are: 100% - 0% tax. The Y-axis extremes are: All the tax goes to the government (Centralization) - All tax goes to the people (Decentralization/UBI). The Z-axis extremes are: Supply outpaces demand (Inflation) - Demand outpaces supply (Deflation).

Once graphing it out, you see that they are equal opposites of each other... the reasons inflation is good are the reasons that deflation is bad and vice versa... this applies to all the axes. So the logical conclusion for a proper medium of exchange is to not have any leaning toward the extremes (x,y,z +/-)...

Once you have that conclusion, you see that the perfect medium would consist of a... 50% tax rate (sounds high but I can get into it*) where half of the tax goes to the government, through a split of equality/equity means (can get into that later too**), and the other half of the tax goes into UBI, also through equality/equity means, and has a per capita supply (matching supply to demand). Doing this cancels out all the extremes and leaves you at (0,0,0) on the graph.

The point of this currency is to provide an autonomous medium of exchange that balances out the extremes of manipulation of value... the current issue I'm having is to find a way to produce it/receive constructive criticism on what may be wrong with it and how to improve it.

*a majority of this tax is refunded... its ""high"" because it's part of the calculation **Equality/equity means has to do with the splitting of funds... for example: 100$ needs to be split between 2 people through equality/equity means. Person 1 previously had 10$ and Person 2 previously had 90$. The new 100$ is split into 2 portions, 50$ into the equality portion and 50$ into the equity portion. In the equality portion, that 50$ is split based on the amount of people. Therefore, both Person 1 and 2 will receive 25$ of this portion. The equity portion is split based on equity. Person 1 has 10% of the total previously owned capital and Person 2 has 90% of the previously owned capital. Therefore, Person 1 receives 5$ and Person 2 receives 45$. In the end, Person 1 received 30$ (now at 40$ total) and Person 2 received 70$ (now at 160$ total)",2025-02-13 18:10:27

Bitcoin + GameStop=?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1iksrzw/bitcoin_gamestop/,10,"
I've seen a couple posts lately of Ryan Cohen (CEO) meeting with with Michael Saylor (Bitcoin guru) does anyone have any thoughts on why these two would meet?  

It's suspected that GameStop stock price is being suppressed by illegal hedge fund activity, is it possible that these two are meeting to find a way to combat this fraud? If so, what would be the best way to use Bitcoin as a tool to fight against corruption?

CLSK Earnings Call Takeaways,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ijkl6i/clsk_earnings_call_takeaways/,4,"• Indirect expenses expected to be FLAT meaning depreciation AND compensation will be constant (aka MORE dollars to shareholders as exahash grows).

• Path to 50 EH/s fully funded with CLOSURE of ATM program (this means much less sell pressure).

• Expansion is the advantage. CLSK supports untapped energy assets in rural America. Flexibility to power off builds relationships with communities. Current strategy will be to expand outside of Georgia to reduce concentration risk from weather changes.

• All mining facilities and rigs are owned entirely by CLSK (increases margins over time). CLSK market share and revenue grow as competitors FOMO into HPC-AI.

• CFO Gary Vecchiarelli said they are open to the idea of returning capital to shareholders via additional share buybacks in the future (likely after expansion goals met).

• $2.8B assets while CLSK market cap is $2.9B. Margins increased per kWh and cost per BTC is down.

• With altcoins in the mud, the best beta play on BTC will likely be CLSK. When it goes up, it might go up quick. Not financial advice. DYOR.",2025-02-07 02:32:54
"""This time is different""",54,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ijeual/this_time_is_different/,17,"[Link to original post I made almost 8 years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/5vdiv3/longterm_pattern/)

Since mid-2014, I've maintained a personal chart for Bitcoin's historical price.  Even at that time, it was interesting to me to see similar trends in stability followed by quick jumps in price.  Perhaps this is Elliott Wave behavior?

[Anyway, I thought I'd share the updated chart](https://imgur.com/a/wduAnox)

The blue line is the price history.  For the red line, it's a rough trace of the first box.  For the third and subsequent boxes, it's about 60% residual height to show some decay over time.  Today, you see quite a bit of this stuff with explanations related to halving cycles, so perhaps this doesn't need too much explanation for people these days.

My point for posting today, is that so many people are caught up with recent news as it relates to Bitcoin.  People have almost always tried to create a narrative around WHY Bitcoin is moving up or down in recent days.  Yes, current events and the actions of larger participants in the ecosystem will have some impact on the charts (MtGox, FTX, US SBR).  And those impacts will cause deviations in the pattern.  But the larger picture is the *almost* inevitable march forward on the curve.  ZOOM OUT!  If SBR happens soon, maybe we get a peak this year.  If not, maybe Apple or a large group of companies start the next stage rolling.  Either way or any other way, it still appears to be fairly early in this cycle.

For those interested, [link to my thoughts on why this behavior exists](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7zhhky/update_on_longterm_pattern/duoc0vp/)

As the sidebar says, this isn't trading advice.  However, most TA is understanding that large populations of people can be ""simulated"" with mathematical models and then finding the one that best fits the data.",2025-02-06 22:03:16

CLSK is likely the most UNDERVALUED out of all BTC mining stocks,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ig77tr/clsk_is_likely_the_most_undervalued_out_of_all/,4,"Links: [Figures 1 to 4](https://x.com/charlesalza/status/1884811658276520184) and [Figures 5 to 8](https://x.com/charlesalza/status/1884817385045066183)

This is a long post that describes why and how CLSK will end up with a higher projected % BTC holdings per market cap in June 2025 REGARDLESS if $BTC gets to $80k, $100k, $120k or $150k (Figure 1). These figures indicate buying CLSK now is worth MORE BTC later. It also means CLSK has MORE EFFICIENT mining operations that are misappropriately valued LESS than worse mining operations by RIOT and MARA. Details below:

If one can’t explain in a sentence what a company does, then it’s unlikely to be a good company. The way BTC miners make money is by acquiring BTC at lower than market value and either selling immediately (like IREN) or holding until BTC price goes up (like LSK). Personally, I do not like it when BTC miners change plans last minute. Unlike RIOT who just announced HPC-AI interest, IREN has a track record of high operational uptime (which is necessary for HPC-AI) and has provided HPC-AI services since 2019.

In a nutshell, both CLSK and IREN have higher operational uptime (Figure 2) and higher efficiency (Figure 3) than competitors RIOT and MARA. Consistently meeting quarterly goals demonstrates efficient growth by IREN and CLSK and exemplifies why these two businesses expand (gaining market share) while competitors (like RIOT and MARA) scramble to mimic others to attract investors.

When it comes to companies holding BTC, CLSK may have more upside than others. Currently, most BTC miners have high percent shorts: CLSK (27.13%), MARA (24.12%), RIOT (19.91%), IREN (7.45%). As a rule of thumb, all shorts must eventually close positions which leads to more buy orders. BTC miners have been lagging BTC due in part to these high shorts and also by the end of year retail sell off brought on by the December federal reserve meeting. However, not every miner prioritizes shareholder value and it’s important to do your own research before buying into these higher risk stocks which are now trading at a much cheaper price.

CLSK has set itself up to be most shareholder friendly BtC holder this bull run. Factors that support CLSK include NO plans for additional ATM's, full funding for growth to 50 EH/s and industry low % revenue going to compensation (Figure 4). Unlike MARA (48.4%) and RIOT (79%), IREN and CLSK have only 29.24% and 24.38% of revenue going towards paying compensation (which is good for shareholders). On 1/10/2025, MARA announced a 300M dilution which will dilute current shareholders by 60%. Because MARA has 333M shares, this potentially means each MARA share can drop close to 50% within a day whenever this dilution gets processed. Furthermore, plans to grow by 7 EH/s and/or pursue HPC-AI means RIOT may likely seek another $750M ATM at the cost of shareholders.

Okay, okay… so what does this all mean? To figure that out, we have to take a look at some numbers...

CLSK will likely have the highest amount BTC holdings in June 2025 per dollar spent TODAY on CLSK shares REGARDLESS of BTC price at $80k, $100k, $120k or $150k. This is based on figures which add up current BTC holdings and projected mining revenue (Figures 5 to 8) with averaged out monthly growth based on current EH/s goals. The amount held in BTC is then divided by market cap (corrected for dilution and ATM) to give the projected percent BTC holding per market cap as shown by Figure 1.

This means that buying CLSK now is worth MORE BTC later. It also means CLSK has MORE EFFICIENT mining operations that are misappropriately valued LESS than worse mining operations by RIOT and MARA. The goal in buying BTC miners is to pick a company that acquires BTC cheaper which generates enough profit to outpace the gains one gets buying BTC. Unlike CLSK whose competitive advantage is finding sites at low cost, RIOT and MARA copied MSTR and took out loans via convertible notes to buy spot BTC. This artificially raised their BTC holdings and only leads to further release of ATM’s and/or dilution at the expense of shareholders tomorrow.

Out of good faith to those interested, I investigated this industry and formed my opinions based on the numbers I have observed. For CLSK, TTM price-to-sale (P/S) will likely drop by June 2025 to \~3.58 (which indicates \~2x value at current prices). CLSK had 39.1 EH/s with revenue of 668 BTC ($70.2M) in December 2024 which beat average revenue of 514 BTC from May 2024 to November 2024. With CLSK fully funding growth of 11.9 more EH/s (30.4%) by H1 2025, CLSK revenue will increase monthly by \~5% for a TTM annual revenue of 8,070 BTC ($807M).

The lower projected 3.58 P/S for CLSK is NOT priced in and does NOT account for holdings which would be \~13913 BTC ($1.39B) by June 2025 at $100k. If BTC reaches $150k by mid 2025, industry low cost of \~$64k per coin mined means CLSK makes \~$694M PROFIT from July 2024 to June 2025. This means CLSK would make $50k MORE PROFIT per coin mined than each coin RIOT and MARA bought at \~$100k. This is where the REAL value lies with mining stocks. If done efficiently, profits can be made, and shareholders can benefit too.

What’s holding Bitcoin back on the bull cycle?,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ievncw/whats_holding_bitcoin_back_on_the_bull_cycle/,67,"I keep hearing that there’s a massive jump about to happen if it follows the path of previous bull cycles.  There’s been so much good news

-15+ states with SBR bills

-MSTR convertible bonds/STRK

-Czech Republic and other nation state interest
 
-Italy bank buying

-Executive Orders from trump

-Lummis bill on the table

-SAB 121 repeal

-Pro Bitcoin appointments by trump
 
-Positive comments on banks adopting BTC services

-more buying from Blackrock and other ETFs

-Relatively good comments from Jerome Powell on banks role with Bitcoin

I’m sure I’m missing more bullish items. The only negative I can think of is the language of crypto and digital assets that gets used and not straight up Bitcoin.  

Is it cause no new money has hit yet?  Countries and states have bills but no inflow of money until they go through. Banks now have more favorable regulations around bitcoin but no big banks have started doing anything yet.  

Things are happening that definitely weren’t priced in.  Some were but some couldn’t have been.  Is it just a matter of time?",2025-02-01 01:56:28

Seeking Advice on DCA Strategy for Investing 70000€ in Bitcoin,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ictadx/seeking_advice_on_dca_strategy_for_investing/,20,"Long-time lurker here. I recently inherited €70,000 and want to invest it all into Bitcoin over the next year or two. I’ve been DCAing small amounts for a while but this is a larger sum.

For context: I sold my car and moved to a walkable city last year, so this money is my “future fund.” I’m risk-aware but don’t want to gamble. My plan is to spread buys over 12-24 months, but I’m second-guessing everything:

What exchanges are the go-to for Europeans? I keep hearing horror stories about withdrawals getting frozen.

Also, everyone says “just DCA and hold,” but are there actually better methods for larger sums? I’ve never managed this much money before. Especially worried about entering at this point in the market. 

No ego here, roast my plan if needed. Just don’t want to regret this in 5 years. Thanks for the wisdom.

Looking for some advice - sell vs collateralized loan?,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ic2j9b/looking_for_some_advice_sell_vs_collateralized/,18,"Alright I'm looking for some advice here on risk management/strategy.  I figured this sub is best to ask.  I hold some bitcoin and have for like 10 years.  Never sold a thing, had a conviction then, and still have it now.  I expect price will still at least double this year.

  
Problem is right now I need some money, and let's say I need 100k for simplicity.   I could sell 1btc, take the profit quick and simple, but then potentially lose out on \~100k in future gains.  

  
Or, I could put 2btc up for collateral, pay 12k interest, and get 100k loan.  If price doubles, I would be saving 88k in this scenario.  But obviously there is the counterparty risk of losing 2btc.  There's also some risk of liquidation if things go south.

  
I do plan to sell/trade/diversify my stack this year anyhow.  So the cap gains isn't a huge consideration. 

  
What would you do?  Take the easy/simple profit and move on with life,  or let it ride and find/manage a btc backed loan, and try to maximize gains at all costs?  I'm not risk averse, it's how I got here in the first place.  But I want to make the smartest decision.

leveraged trading in the US?,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1i9cbt5/leveraged_trading_in_the_us/,21,"I'm interested in doing some mild trading with leverage and I am wondering what you all find is the best option for US customers. I've opened accounts at Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken and done some exploring and research.

  
I gave coinbase a try but to be honest I don't fully understand the futures contracts.  It's not completely intuitive to me what is going on, and what the margin requirements/liquidation levels are.  I've since ready many bad reports of contracts settling incorrectly?  But maybe that were people who didn't understand how they work? or things have improved since then?

Gemini doesn't seem to offer any leveraged trading in the US

Kraken seems like a pretty straightforward margin trading but it's looking like it says you need 10 million USD to qualify?  But it's up to you to say whether you qualify?  Is that just a formality?

  
Any other options out there?",2025-01-25 01:58:34

After the recent run I decided to realise some small profits. Most of it I’m putting into my ISA and the other half I want to try trading BTC. 

I appreciate this is basically gambling and I will probably loose everything, but it’s not much and I want to FAAFO to learn more about the market in general and have some fun.

What is the most honest and reliable place to learn this?

What Ross Ulbricht's release means for Bitcoin,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1i7em33/what_ross_ulbrichts_release_means_for_bitcoin/,19,"Ross Ulbricht has been pardoned and is now a free man. I can't help but wonder how this will impact the price of Bitcoin. I've seen so many other posts in different subs talking about how he could possibly be the richest man in the world, with billions stored away in Bitcoin. I would expect to see a massive sell off so that he can buy some nice accommodations and other things for himself. Which would probably result in a massive price drop, right? What do you guys think?

Is Trump or his people smart enough to see what others have done before him?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1i5smz4/is_trump_or_his_people_smart_enough_to_see_what/,5,"Imagine SBF but never having given CZ enough coins to rekt him. What would be the state today if CZ hadn't dumped on him?

I imagine FTX would still be running, Bitcoin would be at SBF's beck and call, loans would be impossible to margin call.

All Trump would have to do is hold the 80% and use some of the loan money to put in bids to prop up the price. Someone out there would be greedy enough to offer loans against it as collateral.

SBF simply took too much meth and couldn't keep track of things.

They gave CZ a bunch of coins to entice him to buy them out when still early, then forgot all about it. The books got messy because they never wanted to record any of the fraud, so they couldn't figure out how much reserve was needed to protect against him selling (or simply didn't realise it was a risk).

CZ got a look at the books and is much smarter, so he knew exactly how much FTT he needed to sell and how much Bitcoin he needed to buy in order to rekt them.

How?

Well... CZ was using BNB in the exact same way, so he knew the game. In the weeks before BNB pumped in order to get the ammo required. Then it all unwound.

Some time later, SBF realised he was rekt. Not long after that, he was in prison.

The first turd is where CZ was positioned.  
The 2nd turd is when SBF realised he was rekt.  
The 3rd turd is when SBF went to prison.

One potential odd path to a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1i5akha/one_potential_odd_path_to_a_bitcoin_strategic/,8,"The Trump administration have repeatedly stated they want to boost exports, reduce imports, and return manufacturing to the USA. This will be very hard to do even with tariffs etc because of the USD role as the global reserve currency. (See the Triffin Dilemma for why).
It will be almost impossible for the USA to reduce current account deficits and trade deficits while maintaining the USD as global reserve currency as they must provide the world with sufficient dollars to trade or else or all falls apart anyway.

A reversion to the gold standard or alternatively a Bitcoin Strategic reserve/Bitcoin standard could be an easy path for Trump to achieve a weaker USD and could be done unilaterally. Even without legislation, if Trump declared that Bitcoin held by govt wouldn't be sold and talked about it a lot, the impact would be significant.",2025-01-19 22:08:38
Post Emergency Analysis PSA: What went right and wrong (but mostly wrong) when I thought evacuation was imminent.,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1i54bls/post_emergency_analysis_psa_what_went_right_and/,27,"This is a tale of a dry run for an emergency-driven backup plan for a btc wallet. When it was happening, however, I did not know it was only going to be a dry run, and so it felt more like a descent into hell. But note: [As I mentioned in my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1hxwvz9/comment/m6fuo5a/), everything turned out OK, the fire guys did astounding work, and there was ultimately no danger to us or our home. I’m recounting the tale only so that some of you might benefit from our experience. 

Let me give you the punchline first: Your backup plan cannot be independent of a general life plan. You need to consider some pretty far out edge cases. I’m sure many of you have done that, but it is worth taking 10 minutes to double check your plan against my story to test the robustness of your plan. If you don’t want to read a wall of text, skip to the bullet summary at the bottom. 

My story of descent into hell starts with my wife and I out for a small nearby hike. At the very end of the hike, I thought I smelled smoke but assumed it was because of the big LA fires just a few miles south of us (these are the ones you have seen on the news.) It turns out that the smoke was probably the beginning of the new Kenneth fire. Shortly after we got home, there was a large plume of smoke and then it was clear this was a new fire. The winds were high and most of the fire fighters were working on the big LA fires so it was hard to know how it would evolve. Within about 10 minutes, we got an “evacuation warning” on our cell phones.  In the language of public emergency messages “evacuation warning” means pack up and get ready to leave, while “evacuation order” means get out and go now.

 As it turns out, we had a written list of items to pull together for evacuations, so I pulled that out and started working through the list as calmly as I could manage. When I got to the wallet thumb drive, I went to where it was supposed to be and my heart sank: It was not there. Around this time, the sheriff drives by with a bullhorn and I thought he was telling us to evac now. At this point, I am relieved that I have a backup drive with a relative far away, because my wife has a number of medical issues and reduced mobility, so I just don’t have time to figure out why my thumb drive is not where it is supposed to be.  I gather up a few more things and head out to the car and make sure the wife is ready, because for all I know this is the last time we see our house before it joins the many smoldering ruins that we’ve seen on the news. 

Now it turns out (thank all the gods) that this was as far into hell as we descended. The actual end of the story went like this: I went outside, and my neighbors were talking to a firefighter. He told us that as long as the winds did not shift, we would likely not have to evacuate, which meant that I had misunderstood what the sheriff driving around with a bullhorn was saying.  (The sheriff was making sure that everyone knew we should prepare to evacuate in case they missed the cell phone message, and the key thing that I misheard is that people *who need a lot of time* should go now.) The fire then grew to about a 1000 acres before it was officially stopped. I will never let a fire fighter buy his own drink from now on. 

However, just before going outside and learning that we were probably going to be OK, there were about a million thoughts racing through my head about how inadequately I had prepared for the possible endings. Now, I thought I was prepared (I had a list! I had a portable backup drive!) but what was most missing from my emergency planning: For a long-time hodler, life is going to change. Your spouse might develop a serious medical issue, and your parent might start showing signs of dementia. You might need to take care of an injured spouse during evacuation, and you will have precisely zero time to allot to your wallet backup plan, because (trust me on this): What is ultimately important becomes screamingly obvious during such moments, and it turns out that btc is not at the top of your list. 

Memorizing passphrases etc is good and all, but you are going to age too. You may suffer an injury in the disaster you are escaping from and you yourself will start experiencing memory loss. So whatever password is only in your head? Definitely rethink that strategy.

That drive you left with an aging parent? They did not know (or did not remember) that you thought it was important. They are preparing to sell their home and downsize, so it went into the trash. (This was roughly true in my case, as I found out later that week. *That* would have been a bad surprise.)

How about where you are going to escape to? Cell phone service was essentially dead. There are bars on the phone (the cell towers are active) but within certain cells you cannot get data or a phone call out. I hope that 911 service was still there (I sure as hell wasn’t going to test it without an actual emergency, those guys were full of them already) and that is why the cell service was alive at all. So you will need some type of offline map. You may think you know the roads, but imagine everyone in your area leaving: Do you know the side roads? How far away?  As you probably heard, there were cases were folks needed to walk away from their cars. This happened because those particular roads were funnels with no productive side streets to utilize. [In one report](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/residents-evacuate-and-flee-as-palisades-fire-grows/), LAFD told people to get out of their cars to escape the flames and then the fire depts bulldozed them out of the way, and [in another](https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-wildfire-windstorm-01-07-25#cm5n82fuo00003b6m6dg9oc1x) report, folks considered heading to the beach in order to escape the flames. 

There is even the case that you are not allowed into your home: When coming back from the hike, I already smelled the smoke. But a little while later, and our path would have been blocked. Does your backup plan include geodiverse recovery? It very much needs to. 

To give you a sense of the blindness that will occur as you are trying to calmly exit and not panic: My backup USB was just a little further down on the shelf. It is now part of a go-bag that I will keep and review every N months (N=6? I think), so that there is one less item to grab. 

So in summary, there are three cases:

* When you are away and your house evaporates for some reason: Have a geodiverse backup, independent of people if possible.
* When there is no time to pack: Grab your [go-bag](https://news.caloes.ca.gov/grab-and-go-bag/), btc backup should be in it.
* When there is time to pack: Grab your [go-bag](https://news.caloes.ca.gov/grab-and-go-bag/) with your btc backup, have a written list of other things to pack. The top of the list should be things you grab first in case you don't have time to grab them all.",2025-01-19 17:52:30

Coinbase vs Fidelity for BTC short term trading,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1i2owt4/coinbase_vs_fidelity_for_btc_short_term_trading/,12,"I have held some BTC in cold storage for multiple cycles. We could see a Bear as usual later this year, or possibly a Supercycle. I have decided to dust off the old wallet and trade my BTC utilizing reliable Technical Analysis. If we have a Bear cycle I should end up with more BTC at the bottom, and if we see a Supercycle my TA should keep me in the game.

My original plan was to move it to a Fidelity Brokerage and trade FBTC, but the problem with that is FBTC only trades 8 hours each day (at best). To do this with more precision I think I need to trade BTC with a Coinbase or with a Fidelity Crypto account.....

I have been backtesting my TA, and I'll do roughly 40 trades over 500 days starting in June.

So 40 trades using either Fidelity Crypto, or Coinbase.

Which would be the least costly?

Which would be more secure?

Strengthening USD with BTC Reserve,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1i1bckp/strengthening_usd_with_btc_reserve/,20,"I get the supply and demand impacts of the U.S. holding BTC as a reserve currency and how it would trigger other governments and businesses to hold BTC.  

Wouldn’t the USD be strengthened if the U.S. government decides to hold larger amounts of BTC in a strategic reserve thus putting downward pressure on BTC in terms of USD?  

The fed keeping interest rates high strengthens the USD

The trump administration (the pro crypto people he has appointed) having a much better understanding of fiat currency and the impacts of printing money on inflation of the USD also strengthens USD if it leads to better policies.

Is the supply and demand situation enough to overcome the strengthening USD to still meet these price targets of $500,000+ floating around?  Maybe it makes more sense for people who don’t have access to USD to hold BTC than those that deal with USD everyday.  

Stronger USD puts pressure on BTC price when expressed in terms of USD. 

Btw, I’m a huge bitcoin bull, just asking questions.  ",2025-01-14 17:27:41

Big Round Numbers Theory,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1i0ezyz/big_round_numbers_theory/,26,"I have a theory, that each cycle has a big round target (x) that is 10 times higher than previous cycle target (y), because people like big round numbers:
    

    Cycle 1: x=100, y=N/A
    Cycle 2: x=1K, y=100
    Cycle 3: x=10K, y=1K
    Cycle 4: x=100K, y=10K
    Cycle 5: x=1M, y=100K

> Fun fact: Cycle 1 reached only 0.3x and never hit the target of x=100. This was because the first exchange and trading appeared only when the cycle was already two years old. Additionally, the price of Bitcoin was incorrectly set to $0.06 at the start of trading, so the price had to increase by more than three orders of magnitude in just two years — a tall order even for Bitcoin. Two years into mining, the fair price of Bitcoin should have been $6 at the start of trading, given the value it was already providing. Cycle 1 is usually excluded from the comparison charts due to its short time span and extreme volatility.

Now, let’s compare cycles 2-5 visually using targets x and y defined above.

My favorite cycle comparison chart is [Bitcoin Price After Halvings](https://x.com/HalvingTracker), however it suffers from two problems:

* **Problem 1**: it creates the false impression of diminishing returns due to unfortunate choice of vertical scaling, horizontal alignment and cycle definition.
* **Problem 2**: it doesn't show very well where we are in the current cycle in respect to common cycle stages for the same reasons.

Now, let’s improve each of these aspects.

# Better Vertical Scaling

Let’s scale this chart to cycle targets x and y defined above: https://imgur.com/a/mkdykNs

# Better Horizontal Alignment

While cycles vary in how quick the bull run starts (e.g., 2020 bull run was notoriously early to start), once the price moves past 1.4y, all cycles behave pretty much the same by shooting almost straight up, so let’s align cycles horizontally to this point in each cycle: https://imgur.com/a/5a58yUu

# Better Cycle Definition

Halvings don’t impact the price immediately and the price just fluctuates after halving boringly for variable number of months in each cycle, so let’s set cycle start to a time when the price moves past approximately 0.6y for the last time, because this is where the real action begins, and cycles start to move in sync: https://imgur.com/a/olJnSyZ

Compared to cycles defined by halving dates, dates of my cycles are offset by 1 to 8 months.

In this chart we finally begin to clearly see common cycle stages:

1. **Fight With Previous Target** – in the first stage all cycles start to immediately tackle the first mini-boss – previous cycle target y. A lot of people want to cash out during this stage, so it takes a lot of time – about 210 days, during which we range between 0.7y and 1.3y. Zoom to stage 1: https://imgur.com/a/GEMshA9

2. **Bull Run** – after slaying the first mini-boss, price shoots almost vertically up towards cycle target x. In this short second stage, we do or do not reach cycle target x, depending largely on the timing of the next China ban. 

3. **Bear Market** – in this stage we never fall below 1.5y (cycle 2 – $152, cycle 4 – $15,479).

4. **Recovery** – the last stage, when price recovers to a level that is higher by a factor of 10 (f10) compared to cycle start. We stay at approximately f10 price level for varying months until this cycle ends and new cycle begins.

Here are all the cycles with start and end dates, start and end price, ratio between end/start price and cycle lengths:



    Cycle 1: 2010-10-07 ($0.06) – 2013-03-20 ($61.7) – 965.32 – 895 days
    Cycle 2: 2013-03-20 ($61.7) – 2016-10-05 ($611) – 9.90 – 1295 days
    Cycle 3: 2016-10-05 ($611) – 2020-04-10 ($6877) – 11.26 – 1273 days
    Cycle 4: 2020-04-10 ($6877) – 2024-10-24 ($68155) – 9.91 – 1658 days
    Cycle 5: 2024-10-24 ($68155) – ? – 10 – 81 days so far

Remarkably, in no cycle have we failed to recover to f10 in the last stage, and this is the main reason why we can expect this cycle to be no different.

What changes though, is time required to do it.

Although duration of cycle 4 of 1658 days seems alarming, we actually reached f10 price during recovery by day 1424 – still under 4 years.  Additionally, cycle 4 was notoriously ahead of cycle 3 in timing at the cost of cycle 3 duration decrease and cycle 4 duration increase. Assuming cycle 4 early bull run was a random artifact and time-to-f10 should increase gradually, let’s shift time-to-f10 for cycles 3 and 4 to follow linear growth:

    Cycle 2: 1295
    Cycle 3: 1273 + 58 = 1331
    Cycle 4: 1424 – 58 = 1366

We can also extrapolate time-to-f10 for cycle 5 if we continue that linear growth:

    Cycle 5: 1366 + 35 = 1401

Given this duration, we can predict cycle 5 date of recovery to f10, by adding 1401 days to cycle start date:

    Cycle 5: 2024-10-24 ($68155) – 2028-08-25 ($681550)

The consistent tenfold increase in Bitcoin price over the last three cycles disproves the theory of diminishing returns. What actually diminishes is the bottom-to-top range, which is difficult to time anyway. I would take a guaranteed and easily timed 900% return every 4 years over better bottom-to-top returns any day. The fact that time-to-f10 increases every cycle by a month and cycle length increases by a few months doesn’t look like a big concern for now as long as increase remains linear. Cycle length increase is expected due to the increasing market cap.

The last remaining question is the alignment of the current cycle on the chart with respect to other cycles. Obviously, we don’t know when will we shoot past 1.4y in this bull run so we cannot align it precisely yet. Using definition of cycle start as a point when the price moves past approximately 0.6y for the last time gives us a few days’ leeway. It is tempting to choose 2024-10-24 as the day of cycle start for now, because it gives unbelievably good fit to the last cycle: https://imgur.com/a/ZlKYCF3

Cycle 5 mirrors cycle 4 over the last 104 days with a correlation of R^2 = 0.93, but with less volatility.

Now that we supposedly know where we are, here are some predictions:

1. We are 81 days into the 210 days of the first stage, the first boss fight is 39% complete and its health bar is already at 61%.
2. We will cross the point of no return at 140K in 129 days on May 22.
3. Barring China ban and assuming we sustain cycle 3 and cycle 4 growth rate, we will reach 1M in another 210 days on December 18.
4. Hopefully, we will peak at 1.337M, so I can win the [Guess The High](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1hr2ybo/2025_guess_the_high_contest/) contest.
5. We fill not fall below 150K in the bear market.
6. We will recover to 680K on August 25, 2028.
7. Cycle 6 will start a few months later with a target of 10M.

Every good theory must be falsifiable, so what benchmarks can we observe?

If stage 1 lasts two times longer, say 400 days, or we don’t shoot past 140K but start fighting it instead, I’d be concerned.

If we observe exponential rather than linear time-to-f10 growth in this and next cycles, both this theory and Bitcoin will be dead.

P.S. One can argue for an existence of a channel in the first stage, if you ignore cycle 2 wicks (is it even legal to do a TA on a cycle comparison chart? lol): https://imgur.com/a/2Xzgzq2

Channel bottom is currently at 75K.",2025-01-13 14:20:52

Advice on Investing in Bitcoin: Spot vs. Futures + Modified DCA Strategy,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1hruzc1/advice_on_investing_in_bitcoin_spot_vs_futures/,14,"Hi everyone!

I’m looking for advice and opinions from more experienced investors regarding my current Bitcoin investment strategy. I’m set on using a DCA (dollar-cost averaging) methodology, but with a bit of a twist. Instead of buying regularly at fixed intervals, I accumulate Bitcoin over time and occasionally increase my investment when the market dips significantly.

Currently, I’m using Binance to trade futures contracts and take long positions. My strategy looks something like this:

1. I buy futures long contracts periodically, following a modified DCA approach.
2. I use low leverage, typically 3x, to manage risk.
3. When the market experiences a sharp dip, I increase my investment slightly more than usual to take advantage of the opportunity.
4. When the position reaches a certain percentage of profit (depending on market conditions), I sell and lock in the gains.

The Issue:

I’m worried about the funding fees that come with futures. I understand that these fees slowly eat into my position’s value over time, which means that if I hold a position for too long, a chunk of the profit goes towards these maintenance costs.

My Questions for You:

1. Would it make more sense to switch entirely to the spot market, trade Bitcoin there, and avoid the funding fees? I’m not looking to hold BTC long term—I just want to profit from trading. However, with spot trading, I lose the ability to use leverage, which could limit my returns.
2. Does it make sense to stick with futures contracts and my modified DCA strategy using low leverage (3x)? This approach allows me to grow my position faster and take advantage of leverage, but the funding fees are a concern.

What would you recommend for someone who:

* Trades on Binance and is familiar with the platform.
* Wants to profit from BTC price movements rather than holding it long term.
* Prefers to use low leverage to minimize risks (3x).
* Occasionally increases investments during significant market dips to take advantage of lower prices.
* Is actively monitoring the market and trades regularly.

I’m also curious about your experiences with funding fees and whether anyone has successfully used futures with a low-leverage DCA strategy on Binance. Thanks in advance for any advice!",2025-01-02 14:32:28

How tightly would you adhere to this chart when analyzing long-term technical analysis?,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1hrbl4r/how_tightly_would_you_adhere_to_this_chart_when/,11,"https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/

What are everyone's thoughts on the rainbow chart? It seems like it does a good job of outlining Bitcoin's cyclical nature. A bull run 1-1.5 years after each halving, followed by a bear market and a bottoming out past year 2 until the next cycle begins.

If this holds true, it seems like we could very much be in range for a 150-200k bull peak in 2025, followed by a retracement back down to 50-100k territory in 2026-2027. Setting us up for a bull run into ~500k territory following the 2028 halving.",2025-01-01 20:23:39
El Salvador Trip Report,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1hrajn1/el_salvador_trip_report/,24,"Keeping this out of the daily because it’s not strictly market-related, but wanted to post it here on this sub because some of you may find it helpful, and because it’s my Reddit home (at the risk of sounding corny) …

Just got back from a week in El Salvador with family including kids. Here’s my report:

BITCOIN:

- Bitcoin use was hit or miss. I offered to pay our driver in Bitcoin, but he wanted a 25% premium due to volatility. I ended up sending it Western Union (which was a pain in the butt), and paying the remainder in cash. Another person I met said their driver preferred payment in Bitcoin though - he found his driver through a Bitcoiner / Salvador person on X, which seems like a good option for contacts in the country. And I spoke with a hotelier in a rural town (Suchitoto) who has a German elderly couple that’s been staying there for a year and a half and pays in Bitcoin. Much more Bitcoin adoption in El Zonte (Bitcoin Beach), but we didn’t go there. We stayed in quiet areas and visited cities and I hardly saw any Bitcoin adoption to be honest. Still room for growth for sure.

- Downtown San Salvador on Christmas Day had a Christmas Market, and part of it was sponsored by Tether. Big Tether and Bitcoin symbols all over the display. Interesting.

COUNTRY OBSERVATIONS:

- It’s incredibly safe. Walked around town at night, left doors unlocked, belongings unsecured on the beach, zero problems. Lots of police and military around city centers and tourist sites. Biggest vices I saw were a few drunk dudes lounging outside the liquor store waiting for it to open in the morning in a rural town, one guy smoking a cigarette, and one guy with a Michael Jordan 23 tat lol. I would not hesitate to come here with my family again. Zero safety concerns.

- Almost zero tourists here. We were the only non-Salvadorans on our plane coming and going, and were met with “Gringo gringo” more than a few times lol. Saw maybe 5 American families our whole stay touring all around the country, and very few other tourists. We were in Costa Rica in the spring, and I thought “man this would have been awesome 20-30 years ago before the hordes of tourists came”. El Salvador is Costa Rica 20-30 years ago.

- The country is beautiful. I’m tempted to move there to be honest. Gorgeous beaches with crystal clear water and black sand, volcanoes, lakes, mountains, Mayan ruins. Beautiful architecture in the old parts of cities and towns. Delicious food. Frankly it’s a paradise untouched by tourism. 

- Because it is untouched by tourism, some things feel a bit third-world. No flushing your toilet paper. Driving is crazy. Trash in the alleys and gutters of cities. Horses on the beach. Stray dogs everywhere. If you are a resort-type person, go to Costa Rica. If you like authenticity, El Salvador is perfect. I loved it. My boomer mom would have been mortified. To each their own.

- Bukele is extremely popular, and I understand why. Our driver was constantly pointing out areas that used to be controlled by gangs. You couldn’t drive thru certain areas without paying a bribe. You couldn’t go to some areas at all without being robbed or killed. The gangs ruled every aspect of life and commerce. Now they are totally gone. Easy for foreigners to judge his methods from our comfortable homes, but the Salvadorans who aren’t criminals can finally live their lives. I may have bought a t-shirt with Bukele’s giant face on it. I’m a fan, for now.

- Lots of investment from China building new tourism sites, the new library in San Salvador, bridges and infrastructure. I’m wary of this due to Africa’s experience, but it’s El Salvador’s business not mine.

- Coming from the US, prices are cheap. Like 50% of what I would expect to pay at home. Costa Rica was more expensive than US, El Salvador is super cheap. Pupusas $2. Frozen pina coladas $3-4. One-hour boat tour of the lake $25 for 8 people. If you’re considering ExpatFIRE, El Salvador should be on the list.

- The people are incredibly welcoming and warm. Almost no English speakers, so some Spanish is a must (can hobble by on Google Translate). Having people thank you for visiting their country is a nice feeling, and high contrast to somewhere like Europe. Lots of smiles and efforts to be helpful. Street vendors were not aggressive at all. 

- Sites visited: San Salvador, Playa San Blas, Surf City / Libertad, Sunzal beach, Tazumal ruins, Santa Ana volcano, Lake Coatapeque, Boqueron, Tamanique waterfalls, Suchitoto, Devil’s Door. 

I think that’s all. To sum it up - awesome experience and will go back again. Bitcoin adoption still has a long way to go. 

Happy to answer questions or DMs. 

Edit: Forgot to mention that the currency is the US dollar, which makes it super simple for Americans - no currency math for each transaction, and no changing money or trying to spend the last of it before coming home.",2025-01-01 19:37:15
2025 Guess the High Contest,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1hr2ybo/2025_guess_the_high_contest/,18,"**Welcome to the 2025 Guess the High contest.**
Inspired by /u/imissusenet 's Guess the Low contest I decided it's now or never to create a Guess the High equivalent for 2025. Here are the rules:

The time window is 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 UTC to 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 UTC.

**What is your guess for the highest price during that window?** (Price is in USD, and comes from Coinbase)


Rules:

1. You get one guess.
1. Guesses must be **messaged to me**, NOT sent as a reply to this post.
1. Guesses must be in $100 increments, in round $100 amounts (i.e. $99900, $165300, etc.)
1. Included with your guess must be the instruction ""higher"" or ""lower"". If your guess has already been entered, your guess will be moved to the next available slot, higher or lower, based on your instruction. (If you guess $99900, but $99900 is already taken, I will move your guess to the next available slot, based on your ""higher or lower"")
1. You must submit an actual number, not ""Whatever the open is on 10th Jan""
1. I reserve the right to toss your entry if you're a pain in the ass about it or don't follow the rules.
1. Guesses will be accepted until 11 Jan 2025 00:00:00 UTC

The person with the closest guess will get their choice of **0.0005 BTC or $50 worth of BTC** at the price at the close of the contest. Once all the entries are in, I will post the guesses here. I will include my guess as well.


Rule #4 is a rule, not a suggestion! Include ""higher"" or ""lower""!

BTC Top Indicators,141,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1hoz0rh/btc_top_indicators/,57,"Alright lads, in an effort to justify my existence here beyond just shitposting, I’ve whipped up a **BTC Cycle Top Indicator Spreadsheet**. Shoutout to u/btc-_- for the inspiration (pour one out for the legend, who seems to have ghosted us).

This is version 1.0, so feel free to roast me with constructive criticism—anything to make this spreadsheet more *signal* than *noise*. Formatting tweaks, broken links, useless indicators to axe, new ones to add—hit me with it all.

The plan is to update this bad boy once or twice a month, but if the market starts getting *spicy*, you bet your ass I’ll be posting it daily. Honestly, I’m looking forward to those chaotic times. Anyway, here it is—go easy on me (or don’t).

|Indicator Description|Indicator & Link|December 29 Value|Flashing?|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|The monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) chart for Bitcoin is king. Comparing the RSI to where previous tops have petered out can show when Bitcoin is overheated. Each cycle is likely to show a smaller RSI peak, so a decline in max RSI over time is expected.|[Monthly RSI >80](https://charts.bitbo.io/monthly-rsi/)|75.5|No|
|The monthly Logarithmic Moving Average Convergence Divergence (LMACD) has been on a macro downtrend. Each cycle top has gotten very close to this down slope. In April 2021, LMACD hit 0.41, and the trendline was at 0.44 (93% of the way to hitting it).|[LMACD within 10% of the down trend line](https://postimg.cc/ZvFtXTbZ)|0.05|No|
|The Pi Cycle Top Indicator has been an easy way to determine if things are overheated.|[Pi Cycle Top Crosses](https://charts.bitbo.io/pi-cycle-top/)|Top is 133k|No|
|The MVRV Z-Score measures how far Bitcoin’s market value is from its realized value in standard deviations, highlighting periods of extreme overvaluation or undervaluation. It improves on the MVRV ratio by standardizing data for better comparisons across market cycles.|[MVRV Z-Score >6](https://charts.bitbo.io/mvrv-z-score/)|2.59|No|
|The Power Law Chart is a linear regression channel based on historical Bitcoin price. It represents the correlation between Bitcoin’s price and time and has been remarkably accurate.|[Halfway up the 'top channel'](https://charts.bitbo.io/long-term-power-law/)|Currently bottom of 'top channel'|No|
|Transaction volume measures the economic throughput of BTC on the blockchain. Onchain Volume reflects the total cryptocurrency moving between wallets on a blockchain, giving insight into network health. Monthly volume exceeding $5 trillion—and reaching an all-time high of $8 trillion—signals significant activity.|[Monthly Volume >$5T, then >$8T](https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/bitcoin/bitcoins-adjusted-on-chain-volume-daily)|2.0T|No|
|The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is a Halving Price Regression (HPR) is a non-linear logarithmic trend line based solely on Bitcoin prices at the three halving dates, excluding hype cycles to provide a conservative price forecast, with colored bands indicating years ahead of the trend.|[Price moves into Orange Band](https://charts.bitbo.io/rainbow/)|Green Band|No|
|Altcoin Season Index refers to a market phase where alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outperform Bitcoin in terms of price growth. The Altcoin Season Index measures this by analyzing the performance of the top 50 altcoins compared to Bitcoin over a given period. A high index score suggests a strong altcoin season, while a low score indicates Bitcoin dominance|[AltSeason Index score >90](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/altcoin-season-index/)|49|No|
|Historically, Bitcoin Transaction Fees Spike during bull market peaks. If daily transaction fees exceed $40, it usually signals overheating.|[Bitcoin average daily transaction fee >$40](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#alltime)|$1.75|No|
|The Volatility-Adjusted Power Law Index (VPLI) adjusts for volatility to provide clearer value regions across Bitcoin’s lifecycle. When red values appear and begin to decline, it aligns with market cycle tops.|[VPLI Red Zone Indicates Cycle Tops (>85)](https://www.bitcoingoodfiatbad.com/charts/power-law-volatility-adjusted-index)|Green, 60|No|
|When Bitcoin Dominance sharply drops (15-20% over 4 weeks), it signals lost momentum, with capital flowing into altcoins or stablecoins. Historically, a dominance level under 47% aligns with market pullbacks.|[15% Pullback within a month or BTC dominance <47%](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/)|4% pullback, dominance 58%|No|
|When the Number of cryptos with a market cap >$1 billion exceeds 200, it often signals overheating. A sustained decline below the 7-week moving average of these coins indicates a market top.|[\>200 coins >$1B cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/?page=2)|99 coins above 1B|No|
|Rising Stablecoin Market Cap (e.g., Tether) can reflect higher purchasing power or profit-taking. If the cap increases significantly over 4 months (e.g., >2.5x), it often indicates higher risk.|[USDT cap >2.5x in 4 months](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BvgWh9QV/)|Up about 15%|No|
|The 200 Week Moving Average Heatmap has historically been a reliable indicator. Orange or red dots on the chart signal market overheating and a good time to sell.|[Orange and Red Dots Appear](https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/200-week-moving-average-heatmap/)|Deep Blue|No|
|The CBBI Indicator combines 9 metrics to estimate Bitcoin market cycles, helping identify price tops or bottoms.|[Confidence >75/100 = Market Peak](https://colintalkscrypto.com/cbbi/)|79|Yes|
|The Mayer Multiple, the current Bitcoin price divided by its 200-day moving average, highlights historically significant price ranges. Values above 2.4 suggest market euphoria.|[Over 2.4](https://charts.bitbo.io/mayermultiple/)|1.33|No|
|The NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) metric shows market-wide profit or loss. Values above 0.75 indicate market euphoria and potential tops.|[Over 75%](https://charts.bitbo.io/net-unrealized-profit-loss/)|57%|No|
|The Terminal Price normalizes historical Bitcoin behavior to current conditions by multiplying Transferred Price by 21 (max supply in millions). This has effectively forecasted cycle peaks.|[Price Rises Above Terminal Price](https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/terminal-price/)|Terminal Price 188k|No|
|The 4-Year MA Multiple compares the Bitcoin price to its 4-year moving average. Historically, peaks above 4.5x have aligned with market tops.|[Value ≥ 4](https://charts.bitbo.io/sma1458/)|\~2|No|
|The Coinbase App Rank hitting the top 10 in mobile store rankings, usually 4 weeks or less before market tops, has historically signaled euphoria.|[Top 10 in App Rankings](https://x.com/COINAppRankBot)|Rank 190|No|
|Google searches for 'Cheapest Crypto' spiking above 75 (trend score) have historically aligned with market euphoria.|[Trend Score >75](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=cheapest%20crypto&hl=en)|44|No|
|The Puell Multiple is a metric that evaluates the selling pressure from Bitcoin miners by comparing the daily mining revenue (in USD) to its 365-day simple moving average. It helps traders assess how miners' revenue impacts market dynamics, particularly during periods of forced selling.|[Pay attention above 2.5](https://charts.bitbo.io/puell-multiple/%20)|1.07|No|

I’m not sure how much the *expected returns* per year for bitcoin should be though. Microstrategy says 30%, is that reasonable? Maybe there’s a way to time it out for the 4 year cycle? 

Curious if anyone has tried calculating how much bitcoin is needed to maintain their lifestyle. I’m guessing I’m not the only trying to live off my bitcoin.",2024-12-19 15:13:56

"How sure are we that there will be another bear market as pronounced as those seen in 2018, 2022 etc? With ETFs could this change the pattern?",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1hfq3un/how_sure_are_we_that_there_will_be_another_bear/,95,"Now that crypto has institutional investment and ETFs, I think it is likely that bear markets and bull runs are going to be less pronounced than they were in the past. Perhaps even the four year cycle that we've come to expect will fall apart soon.

The thing is all of us are waiting for 2026 or so for the next bear market, and we all are going to buy in then. However, how disappointed would we be if (lets assume this round BTC peaks at 140K) BTC actually bottomed out at 90K or something, and then in the next run it just made it to 180K in 2028. This scenarios would likely be disappointing to many on here, but I see this type of thing is pretty realistic.

At a certain point, is it not true that this whole thing will not be happening? After all, if cryptocurrency indeed does become a major currency, its value will be pretty stable. None of this stuff will matter anymore. How far is that though?

How powerful is the halving in reality?

"₿itcoin priced at $100,000 is a better buy than ₿itcoin priced at $10,000.",95,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1h9xo3y/itcoin_priced_at_100000_is_a_better_buy_than/,103,"The reasoning? A higher price reflects a de-risked asset. Think of all the big institutional players in the game now. They wouldn't give #Bitcoin the time of day at $10k. The network is more secure, has better infrastructure, and is less vulnerable to regulatory uncertainty. Bitcoin has fought and won many battles in its short lifespan. It is the strongest computer network in the world. You didn't miss out on Bitcoin; you missed out on the #risk.

BTC investment vehicle idea,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1h9ugb5/btc_investment_vehicle_idea/,6,"I just thought of an interesting BTC investment vehicle idea to that may appeal to the more risk-averse investors that are watching from the sidelines. Maybe they want in on the long-term upside but are too nervous about the large drops and long-tail BTC-to-zero risks. 

Basically it is an ETF like IBIT but instead of all the funds going to buy BTC, some small amount of it automatically buys put options at some % drop threshold as a hedge against large drops. The amount spent on the options are rolled into the MER. 

For example there may be a ‘conservative’ variant which has a higher MER but attempts to protect against any drop larger than 20%. This may suit older investors who can’t handle large drops since they need the funds for retirement living so are happy to pay for the ‘insurance’ but still get exposure to large upside. There may be ‘mid-level’ and ‘aggressive’ variants to protect against 40% and 60% drops with progressively lower MER. 

I’m sure advanced investors, companies and institutions already do this manually but this would be pre-packaged product for the average investor in their IRA/RRSP. Could be a way to on-board some of the more conservative investors. ",2024-12-08 22:19:18

Best trading approach/platform to maximize bitcoin instead of usd? The death of bitcoin as collateral...And where to trade with no kyc?,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1h8iq62/best_trading_approachplatform_to_maximize_bitcoin/,12,"Life happened and I took a long time off trading, now I'm back to take some leveraged punts on crypto. (yes I'm probably a top signal)

Back in the day inverse perpetual swap contracts that used bitcoin as collateral dominated. It was awesome in bull markets since trading grew your bitcoin stash (hopefully) and your bitcoin stash appreciated all the while (hopefully).

Currently the most popular perpetual swaps are not inverse, and settle in usdt which seems to me a pretty lame concept in a bull market. So to be able to trade you have to sit in usdt?? Eww. I suppose you could always have at least a 1x long open to pretend you're holding spot, but now you're paying funding constantly which seems stupid.

And my uh, trading partner, ahem... is in the US with a VPN and can't use the places that still have inverse swaps with decent volume like bitmex, binance, bybit, since they're KYC exchanges.

So... Are there any non kyc exchanges that offer crypto margined perps with half decent volume? Maybe dex's offer a solution?

Or more simply to the end goal, what's the modern approach to trading with the primary focus of increasing your bitcoin stack?",2024-12-07 02:43:52

2025 Guess the Low Contest,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1h47grk/2025_guess_the_low_contest/,34,"It's the 4th Annual ""Guess the Low"" contest. Here are the rules:

1. The time window is 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 UTC to 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 UTC.
2. What is your guess for the lowest price during that window? (Price is in US$, and comes from Coinbase.)
3. You get one guess.
4. **Guesses must be messaged to me, NOT sent as a reply to this post.**
5. **Guesses must be in $100 increments, in round $100 amounts (i.e. $99900, $102300, etc.)**
6. **Included with your guess must be the instruction ""higher"" or ""lower"". If your guess has already been entered, your guess will be moved to the next available slot, higher or lower, based on your instruction. (If you guess $99900, but $99900 is already taken, I will move your guess to the next available slot, based on your ""higher or lower"".)**
7. Guesses will be accepted until 11 Dec 2024 00:00:00 UTC.
8. You must submit an actual number, not ""Whatever the open is on 1 Jan"".
9. I reserve the right to toss your entry if you're a pain in the ass about it or don't follow the rules.

The person with the closest guess will get their choice of 0.0005 BTC or $50 worth of BTC at the price at the close of the contest. Once all the entries are in, I will post the guesses here. I will include my guess as well.

Note that the increment rule has changed! Your guess needs to end with at least 2 zeros!

**EDIT:  Rule #6 is a rule, not a suggestion!  Include ""higher"" or ""lower""!**

Let’s talk about Bitcoin price retractions (why they happen and when the next one is coming),24,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1h24dzb/lets_talk_about_bitcoin_price_retractions_why/,21,"The so called “crypto winter” of 2022 shocked many new investors of crypto, but the history of Bitcoin tells us these retractions are quite normal-healthy, even.  They seem to occur approximately a year after Bitcoin hits ATH for that 4 year cycle.  Here are some notable past retractions.

1. December 2013 : Bitcoin = $1000.
December 2014: Bitcoin = $375.(62% drop)

2.December 2017 : Bitcoin = $17,000.
December 2018 : Bitcoin = $3,200.(80% drop)

3.November 2021 : Bitcoin = $64,000.
November 2022: Bitcoin = $16,000.(75% drop)

So why does this happen?  And will it happen this current cycle?

The why:

For each price retraction, you can potentially argue for unique reasons why they occurred.  For example, in 2022 the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 7 times, from nearly 0 to 4.25-4.50%.

But in general, I believe the reliable timing of these price retractions (admittedly with only 3 data points) signal that they occur due to pure crowd psychology and the fact that demand side buying pressure is difficult to sustain over long periods of time.  Remember that demand typically increases approx. one year prior to halving and at this point in the cycle, increased demand needs to be sustained for nearly 3 continuous years to keep increasing price.

The factors at ATH are: 
1. Investors begin taking profits.
2. People who bought near the top due to FOMO (and have little regard for fundamentals) see this correction due to selling pressure and panic sell, fueling further losses.  
3.  The news cycle starts to report on the “bubble bursting,” often reporting headlines without proper context (“Bitcoin down 35%!” Without stating the time period it was down 35%)
4. Many investors of Bitcoin are aware of the 4 year cycle.  And while we collectively prepare for the post halving bull run, as price reaches a hypothetical ATH, it’s every man for himself in terms of exit strategy.  You take profits based on your own unique financial situation.  Demand side pressure slowly decreases, and the price trades sideways for months, followed by slow losses but constant losses each month.

Conclusion: So will we see another price retraction this cycle?

Answer:  Most likely, yes.  But it depends on why you believe they occur.  If you believe, as I do, that price retractions are fundamentally due to 2 things-The difficulty in sustaining increased demand side buy pressure over 3 continuous years and basic crowd psychology-

Then, yes, a huge price retraction is coming one year after BTC hits ATH.  If Bitcoin maxes out at 150k in December 2025, history tells us that December 2026 could reveal a Bitcoin price of $50,000 (65% drop.). 

If you believe that each price retraction was unique in nature, then no, there may not be one this cycle.  

Cheers!

Is the next 5 years going to be the era of Bitcoin that bucks the previous trends?,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1h20l2n/is_the_next_5_years_going_to_be_the_era_of/,23,"I’m sure everyone on here has seen the various graphs out there showing how the price of Bitcoin has moved over the years and how there is a pattern that is expected to continue - highs and lows and imminent highs after the halving events etc. 

Can anyone foresee a situation where this trend/pattern is broken due to all of the things that have happened and are due to happen? E.g some of the most wealthy and powerful companies in the world getting involved in Bitcoin like Blackrock, the Cynthia Lummis bill that proposes that the US gov purchase 200,000 bitcoins every year for 5 years. And then there is the other stuff that will be good for the crypto industry more generally, Gensler resigning and being replaced with a more crypto-friendly head, companies like Ripple being unshackled after the court case comes to an end. 

There is a lot of positive things happening right now for crypto and due to happen, but will it really be enough to send the crypto industry soaring and establish it as the 12th sector of the S&P500, like Kevin O’Leary has predicted?",2024-11-28 17:07:26

Stock Investing Question for Bitcoin,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1gzlbhe/stock_investing_question_for_bitcoin/,8,"I have a pension with a former employer that is unfortunately going to be locked into a LIRA.  I wanted to just buy Bitcoin but here we are! 

I currently have a generic higher risk portfolio picked by SunLife. I would like to pick my own investments and am looking at MSTR. Would you allocate the LIRA to just MSTR? What other companies have bitcoin or are likely to have Bitcoin on their balance sheet? Any industries that would be aligned with Bitcoin that would be good investments? Any other advice?

A look back at the BoA Multiplier calculation,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1gyyfd6/a_look_back_at_the_boa_multiplier_calculation/,7,"Some time ago, I got interested in the Bank of America calculation of the multiplier. Many people assumed that knowing the multiplier would enable you to calculate a future price by simple multiplication of the net amount of dollars invested. [ I posted a calculation showing that using their multiplier was not so simple](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/194358b/price_estimates_using_the_boa_multiplier/), and the price goes as the square root of the total dollars invested.

So as we approach $100K/btc, I was curious how things have played out over nearly a year.  I am going to assume that the total dollars locked into bitcoin for the multiplier is equal to the total ETF investment given [here](https://farside.co.uk/btc/) ($30.8B).  Also, I'm going to add in the total MSTR investment as given [here](https://mstr-tracker.com/) ($16.5B), and since I don't have the full MSTR ownership history, we're going to assume it all happened this year, which is an overestimate, but since my total investment is ETF+MSTR only, hopefully the overestimate captures some of the other investment that is being ignored.

With those (somewhat crappy) assumptions, and using the BoA multiplier value of 135, **the price predicted is $147K per bitcoin**.

OK, that's pretty far off. What could contribute to the error?

1. My overestimate of MSTR ownership happening all in the current year
2. The multiplier as calculated by BoA is too high
3. TheRe ARe EvIL mAnIpUlaTORs KEePING ThE PriCE DoWn!!1!

My best guess is reason 2, so I can turn around the calculation and use a current price of $97K and **solve for the multiplier instead. which turns out to be close to 50 at a price of $47K.**

I found it to be an interesting way of looking at price prediction in any case, and I have to wonder what price discovery is going to look like above $100K because I find it difficult to believe that BoA's multiplier is going continue to make any sense if the price accelerates higher.

Edit: To /u/[FreshMistletoe](https://www.reddit.com/user/FreshMistletoe/) point below, there's another way to look at it. Assuming that the multiplier is indeed 135, then another implication is that the total locked-up investment into bitcoin has increased by only $17B, implying that there has been about $30B of sales from lettuce-hands.

Selling at 100k?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1gyvjj5/selling_at_100k/,39,"Hi Guys,

I’m thinking of selling at 100k. But since there so many sell orders at 100k. I’ll probably sell it at 99k.

When BTC hit 100k, I’m assuming there going to be so many mainstream media news.

Problem is I think it going to hit 100k, then dip and I buy it at a lower price. 

Or do you think it going to hit 100k and still go up do to the market news craze. ",2024-11-24 16:55:40

Rise/Fall Statistics,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1gxhb8e/risefall_statistics/,9,"I made a spreadsheet with the closing prices of BTC every day since 1/1/2018 to perform some analysis on the data. Mostly for fun, because predicting how the market goes is a complete gamble, but I found my results an interesting find. Maybe others will point out the flaws or maybe it's more interesting than I think 🤷🏻 but wanted to share it for discussion. 

In my analysis, I determined which day of the week was most likely to have BTC price rise and which would most likely fall. Of the 2,518 data points (days), here are the numbers I have (#rise/#fall): 

Monday (181/185)

Tuesday (190/176)

Wednesday (198/167)

Thursday (170/195)

Friday (191/174)

Saturday (207/158)

Sunday (196/169)

Using this data, I determined the probabilities of rise/fall for each day of the week to find which days are most likely to rise/fall, here are those results in order of most likely to rise: 

Saturday (56.71%) - best day

Wednesday (54.25%)

Sunday (53.70%)

Friday (52.33%)

Tuesday (51.91%)

Monday (49.45%)

Thursday (46.58%) - worst day 

My personal results of this analysis: I started trading BTC 3 weeks ago. By day trading with $150, I've earned about $16 (with fees accounted for) and paid about $20 in trading fees. Whereas if I kept the SATS I bought originally, they'd have gained about $49 in value. Therefore, my ultimate takeaway is that day trading offers a way to keep the money in circulation, possibly the ability to keep money safer from the market drops, but in the end also shields you from potential long term gains as well.

I wanted to perform this analysis to compare potential of day trading to long term investments and out of curiosity. My takeaway is that weekends are generally great for price increases, and generally price will dip before and after the weekend. That said, statistics can be bullshit and there could be any number of other factors haha but I thought it was interesting nonetheless. Thoughts?

Edit: had Friday in the wrong place in my final list lol",2024-11-22 20:19:48
It's Always a Good Time to Invest,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1gx3x8k/its_always_a_good_time_to_invest/,9,"I’ll admit, I was skeptical about Bitcoin at first. It sounded too abstract, too volatile, and honestly, too good to be true. But over the years, as I’ve watched the financial world evolve and crumble in certain areas, I’ve come to realize something: it’s never a bad time to buy Bitcoin. Let me explain why.

Bitcoin is more than just a digital coin; it’s a hedge. Against inflation, against the instability of traditional markets, against the uncertainties of a centralized financial system that can be manipulated. While governments print money endlessly, eroding the value of every dollar I save, Bitcoin operates on a fixed supply. Only 21 million will ever exist, period. There’s no quantitative easing, no bailouts, no central authority pulling strings. It’s a foundation built on scarcity and trust in the code.

Then there’s the growing adoption. I’ve seen major companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, countries experimenting with making it legal tender, and even my tech-savvy friends starting to take it seriously. These aren’t random trends—they’re signals of a paradigm shift. Every day, Bitcoin inches closer to mainstream acceptance, and I want to be ahead of that curve.

People always say, “But it’s so volatile!” Sure, it can spike or crash in the short term, but zoom out. Look at its history. Over the years, the trend is clear: upward. It’s like planting a tree; you don’t panic over a windy day if you know that tree will bear fruit for decades. The dips? I see them as buying opportunities, not setbacks.

What really gets me, though, is the freedom Bitcoin offers. It’s mine—completely. No bank can freeze it, no government can seize it. I’ve always wanted my money to be just that: mine. Bitcoin gives me that autonomy, and there’s a certain power in knowing I’m part of a decentralized network that transcends borders, time zones, and middlemen.

So yeah, Bitcoin isn’t just an investment to me—it’s a belief in a better way. Whether prices are high, low, or somewhere in between, I’ve realized that buying in is never a bad decision. It’s a vote for financial independence, for innovation, and for a future that I’m proud to be a part of.

Bitcoin Cup and Handle Pattern Targeting 124k!,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1guifm8/bitcoin_cup_and_handle_pattern_targeting_124k/,5,"The Bitcoin weekly/daily chart is a picture perfect cup and handle playing out.

According to TradingView's auto chart pattern tool the target is 124K!

The cup and handle consists of an overall uptrend, a pullback/consolidation forming the cup, the handle, and then the breakout at the neckline.

In this case, the neckline is around 68K, and the bottom of the cup is around 16K, subtracting these gives you 52K.

The target price is the difference of the bottom of the cup and the neckline (52K) added to the neckline breakout zone, which is 68K.

52K + 68K = 120K

While this is slightly off from the exact TradingView target price of 124K, that is how you can calculate it manually.",2024-11-18 23:07:00

I understand there’s an expense ratio of 1.29%. If they’re giving me 2x gains though, 1.29% off the top doesn’t hurt. 

Is there some other factor besides the expense ration that makes me lose money over time that I’m not aware of?

Where/How to start investing in crypto as a 17 year old?,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1grmaub/wherehow_to_start_investing_in_crypto_as_a_17/,30,"Hi everyone! I’m 17 and really interested in getting started with cryptocurrency, especially after learning about projects like XRP and Shinabu. I know being under 18 has some limitations, so I’m looking for advice on the best ways to start learning and practicing. Are there any good websites, apps, or simulation platforms that can help me understand the basics and prepare for investing when I turn 18? Also, any tips on security and which platforms are good for beginners would be a huge help. Thanks in advance for any guidance!",2024-11-15 02:39:54

PSA: Bitcoin 4-year cycles are not real,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1gjvuyy/psa_bitcoin_4year_cycles_are_not_real/,17,"Hype cycles reflect price discovery dynamics within distinct maturity/adoption phases. Bitcoin in 2024 is very different from 2010, 2013, or 2017.

While cycles will continue, their timing and magnitude aren't predictable because the underlying dynamics keep evolving. 

I do have two predictions:

1. Cycle timing will compress due to accelerating change

2. Amplitude becomes unpredictable as we shift from speculation-driven to adoption-driven network effects. Expect a ""super cycle"" when Bitcoin enters mainstream - marked by infrastructural shifts like banks offering Bitcoin-denominated accounts.",2024-11-05 02:02:06

My butt-pulled hypothesis on price action,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1g7pjbn/my_buttpulled_hypothesis_on_price_action/,17,"We reached all-time high before the halving then piddled around for seven months after. Why? I’ve got reasons. Butt-pulled reasons, but they are reasons. 

This assumes halvings mean something. It also assumes exogenous factors like the 2020 money printing bonanza, 2021 China mining ban, and 2024 ETF approval affect the price as well. 

The 2020 halving happened on 5/11/20. Bitcoin reached a new all time high 219 days later on 12/16/20. It then continued upward until the China ban. 

In 2024, the Bitcoin price was $42,853 on the day the ETFs launched. It piddled around for a bit then rocketed into the fifth dimension in February going past ATH before the halving. **This was because of the ETFs**. THEN, that ran out of steam. It stopped propelling the price into the stratosphere. 

The price fell and rose and fell and rose and piddled around prompting people to declare the #58KGang. The ETFs were enough to keep it above the level it should have been without the ETFs, but they weren’t powerful enough to rocket it anymore. If there were no ETFs, Bitcoin would have gradually gone from $42,853 to \~$64K today with normal Bitcoin variance. 

It’s now 183 days after the 2024 halving. It will be 219 days on 11/24/24. We can expect choppiness until approximately then at which point Bitcoin will resume its upward trajectory. 

Or the hypothesis is malarkey. I said it was butt-pulled. But it did occur to me.",2024-10-20 03:08:01

2x leverage swing trading scenario: good for fiat gains but diminishing returns for reinvesting in underlying asset?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1fz3rf3/2x_leverage_swing_trading_scenario_good_for_fiat/,7,"I am looking into using leverage for swing trading. I am still new to this and won't consider actually leverage trading before I better understand it, don't worry.

Here's a scenario. I hold 1 BTC and I will use 2x leverage (which is the maximum I am comfortable with for swing trading given its corresponding liquidation price). To simplify I won't include fees in my calculations. I close out the trade after each theoretical price increase and use the profits to buy BTC.

Scenario 1: BTC doubles in price, and I will have 1.5 BTC instead of 1 BTC (if I just held my BTC).  
Scenario 2: BTC triples in price, and I will have 1.66 BTC instead of 1 BTC.  
Scenario 3: BTC quadruples in price, and I will have 1.75 BTC instead of 1 BTC.  
Meanwhile, in fiat terms I will have made 1, 2 or 3 times (in scenarios 1 to 3, respectively) my inital btc investment (in USD) in profits. But I do not want fiat, I want Bitcoin. so for accumulating Bitcoin it is markedly less interesting than for making fiat gains. So it would make sense for me to only use this strategy if I invest the profits in something else than the underlying asset, like the stock market for instance.

I am all-in on crypto and it would be good for me to diversify by investing in the stock market. In this case I think 2x leverage swing trading would be attractive, trying to exit at 2-3x current market price. But it is a lot less attractive reinvesting the profits into the underlying asset, BTC, given the diminishing returns.  
Please let me know if my analysis has been sound thus or if I am missing something. I would not be comfortable increasing my liquidation price as the BTC price goes up.



Edit: the more I think about it, the more answers I think I am getting. Diminishing returns doesn't have to be a problem as long as Bitcoin outpaces, say the stock market, by roughly 2.5x (quick math). Given year on year historical growth records one would predict it will outpace the stock market by a far greater ratio so, actually, investing the leverage trade gains into Bitcoin will still be better than investing it into an asset like stocks.

Edit 2 months later, probably no one will read this but just in case: do your due diligence. There was a lot I didn't know about and still don't. I haven't used leverage and discovered more drawbacks such as rebalancing. Leverage is for short term and people who know what they are doing. Futures I can't trade where I live.

strike options bs,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1fwcwyq/strike_options_bs/,1,"i'm sure many of you are aware of the strike options feature on crypto.com. something about it is super fishy. first of all, what is the price based on? it doesn't match up with the actual price of bitcoin, it's usually around $200 or so under from what i've observed. also trend patterns for some reason are super unrealistic and if you pay for a contract based on a potential trend you see, 4 out of 5 times the graph will betray you in the worst way possible. also every time i've had a near perfectly guaranteed prediction, it'll give me an error message about my network connection, then the graph will proceed to rapidly go the way i predicted, making the contract worthless by the time i try again. what's up with any of that?",2024-10-04 23:28:45

It is still very much an idea, I have managed to pull live market data and implement technical analysis.

However, before putting in a major investment of capital and time, I'd like to get everyone's feedback as to whether this is something you'll be interested in using and how much would you be willing to pay if it consistently gave you good callouts.

Consider this a market fit research.

"According to ChatGPT, the exchanges won't run out of bitcoin anytime soon",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ftz26x/according_to_chatgpt_the_exchanges_wont_run_out/,9,"I have been baffled at the fact that financial institutions have been buying more bitcoin each day that the amount is created by the miners without affecting the price much. Bitcoin did reach a new all-time high for a day or so at the time the ETFs were approved in the US, and since then bitcoin's price has stabilized at around $60,000.



Also, the charts I have seen that show how the amount of bitcoin in cryptocurrency exchanges keeps decreasing are misleading. The y axis on these graphs stop at the lowest amount of bitcoin available. If the y axis stopped at zero it would indicate more clearly how much the amount is decreasing and how long will it be until exchanges run out of bitcoin. So I asked ChatGPT to give me an estimate. Here it is below.



Remember that the price of bitcoin can skyrocket at any time for a variety of reasons. However, if ChatGPT's data is correct and if the only variable we are taking into account is how the bitcoin in the exchanges is decreasing, it seems like bitcoin's price will remain stable for the foreseeable future.

It’s interesting to see how closely they’re moving together now. I’m curious how long this will last—do you guys think Bitcoin will break away from this trend soon and start its own independent rally, or will it stay linked to the traditional market for a while?

In binance I have 10000 usdt.

I buy btcusdt with 5 times leverage.

Let's say btcusdt is 50000 spot.

This means i am  now long 1 btc
My equity is 0.20 btc and the loan is 0.80 btc.

Questions

Is my loan 40000 usdt or 0.8 btc?
The  margin interest  rate is in usdt or btc?

Wyoming Blockchain Symposium: Day 1 Recap (8/20/2024),11,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1eytie4/wyoming_blockchain_symposium_day_1_recap_8202024/,11,"**Hosted by:** SALT, Kraken, and the University of Wyoming Center for Blockchain and Digital Innovation.

The event kicked off with Anthony Scaramucci sharing his cell phone number (917-439-3646) and speaking alongside David Ripley, the CEO of Kraken, an exchange where you can buy and sell digital assets. Ripley, a University of Illinois alum, has been involved in crypto since 2013. He emphasized two key messages:

**David Ripley** - CEO of *Kraken* UIUC alum been in crypto since 2013.

His two messages were

1)The U.S. is falling behind in crypto innovation and is no longer a leader in the space.

2) Innovation is crucial for both business growth and development.He believes the cycles are becoming more muted, (not as drastic highs and lows)

Ripley noted that crypto cycles are becoming more muted (less drastic in highs and lows). He highlighted that this year, over 50% of hedge funds have some exposure to the Bitcoin ETF, although their crypto allocations remain small. He anticipates more adoption within the next two years, especially from pension and sovereign funds. Kraken is focused on attracting more institutional and retail investors as they expand their global presence. He also sees the Middle East gradually entering the crypto space and expects another situation like FTX could occur.

**Salman Khan, CFO of Marathon Digital (a global Bitcoin miner)**

Khan discussed the backlog of large utility-scale projects expected to power data centers and noted increased interest from institutional investors. He predicted that energy harvesting businesses will replace traditional utility-scale Bitcoin mining within the next 4-8 years. Currently, they heat 11,000 homes in Finland through Bitcoin mining.

**Amy Oldenborg, Head of Emerging Markets at Morgan Stanley:**

Oldenborg advised reading the fine print regarding Morgan Stanley's recent announcement allowing registered clients to offer Bitcoin ETFs. This offering is only for taxable brokerage accounts, which represents a small part of their business but is still a significant first step.

**Joseph Chalom, Managing Director at BlackRock:**

Chalom is part of BlackRock’s small digital asset team and helped grow and scale the Aladdin platform. He emphasized that client demand drives everything they do. While not everyone is interested, BlackRock aims to offer crypto services in safe ways for those who are. He mentioned that clients are interested in tokenizing various assets, including buildings and income streams. Chalom also pointed out the need for a regulator-accepted digital identity solution and stressed BlackRock’s responsibility to educate the industry on crypto.

**Jenny Johnson, CEO of Franklin Templeton ($1.6 trillion asset manager):**

Johnson is the third-generation leader of Franklin Templeton, which her grandfather founded. They have tokenized a money market fund, participate in staking, and have a venture capital fund investing in the crypto space. She predicts that ETFs will eventually be tokenized. Johnson’s main focus is on blockchain and AI as disruptive technologies and emerging trends.",2024-08-22 20:21:32

"5 Challenges in Crypto Trading

",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1en2z2d/5_challenges_in_crypto_trading/,4,"Crypto trading can be both exciting and challenging. Let’s explore some common reasons why people may face difficulties in this space:

1. **Lack of Education and Research**: Jumping into crypto trading without understanding the fundamentals is like trying to swim without knowing how to float. Many beginners fail because they don’t take the time to learn about blockchain technology, different cryptocurrencies, and trading strategies. It’s crucial to educate yourself and stay informed.
2. **Emotional Trading**: Ah, emotions—the wild horses of the trading world! When prices swing wildly, fear and greed can take over. Some traders get emotionally attached to a specific project or coin, leading them to make impulsive decisions. Remember, trading should be based on analysis, not feelings.
3. **Overleveraging**: Leverage can amplify gains, but it can also magnify losses. Some traders dive into high-leverage positions without fully understanding the risks. It’s like riding a rocket—you might reach the moon, or you might crash back to Earth. Be cautious with leverage!
4. **Ignoring Risk Management**: Picture this: You’re on a tightrope, and below you is a pit of hungry alligators (okay, maybe not alligators, but you get the point). Traders who neglect risk management fall off that tightrope. Set stop-loss orders, diversify your portfolio, and don’t bet the farm on a single trade.
5. **Chasing Hype and FOMO**: Crypto markets move at warp speed. When a coin suddenly skyrockets, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) kicks in. People buy in at the peak, only to see the price plummet shortly after. Remember, not every moonshot is destined for the stars. 🚀

I believe the bull run will continue, especially since the past 3-4 FOMC meetings have been followed by a 20% pump. With lower inflation, it seems like a good time for investors to jump back into crypto. I’m optimistic that this positive trend will keep driving Bitcoin higher.

When will Bitcoin go down in terms of value?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1d70jmw/when_will_bitcoin_go_down_in_terms_of_value/,40,"Currently, BTC value is very high, meaning it's not the right time to buy BTC. I know I have to wait for BTC to fall and has its value reduced before I buy and then wait for the value to grow and sell it.

Yeah, I'm new to this and I may use crypto to make some money. I'm not aimed at big amounts of money, such as millions, by the way.

Based on past and present BTC trends, is it possible to forecast when BTC value will fall again?",2024-06-03 09:44:06

"So I’ve been using Fidelity, trying out Binance.",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1d4gisg/so_ive_been_using_fidelity_trying_out_binance/,16,"So I’m new to bitcoin (a few months, first bought when bitcoin was 61k).  Fidelity’s fees have cost me a couple thousand dollars due to their 1% tax on any sell or buy (disregarding my net increase).  I saw binance had a much lower rate and decided to try them out, (here’s the newbie question) but why are there two “stablecoins” on bitcoin’s selection and not just the BTC/USD that is present on Fidelity or Google?  Why even make a “stablecoin” that is different but tied to the usd?  I truly don’t understand, but instead of normal bitcoin I get these options:

BTC/USDT,
BTC/USDC

They’re even priced differently (although barely)

Why?  Can someone explain this to me like I’m 5?  Sorry for the stupid question but thanks in advance ",2024-05-30 22:43:03

Since then, Bitcoin has closed a second green weekly candle, which is great! However, we need to be cautious because this week didn't end with a strong closing. It's possible we might face more resistance around the $70K area.

Trading curb,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1d0xy4c/trading_curb/,17,Ok guys and gals. Call me crazy but why can’t a ban on short term day trading be placed on all Bitcoin purchases? Seems to me that this hyper-active bot and trader driven trading is killing bitcoin’s natural value appreciation. A new plague of third world digital  subsistence farmers have descended like locusts that destroy any green shoots before they can take hold. This parasitic action is reflected in the constant roller coaster movement we see on the graphs.  If all buy transactions on the block chain prevented selling within a reasonable period surely this would stablize this parasitic short term profit taking and contribute to a more consistent value curve? Don’t respond with snarky questions because I don’t have answers for how this would or could be instituted  - I’m just theorising for sharper minds to consider…,2024-05-26 09:50:02

"Was it smart of me to close my levered long position while up 140%? Or should I have waited for higher gains?
",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1czz0qw/was_it_smart_of_me_to_close_my_levered_long/,25,"I will try to simplify this as much as possible:

In september 2023, I took out a $25k loan (CC balance transfer, 5% fee, 0% interest for the first 12 months).

I put all $25k into bitcoin when it was around 25-27k. I bought 1 bitcoin. Brought my total holdings to 1.57.

When bitcoin was 65k this month (may), I sold 0.4 Bitcoin (worth 25k) and used that 25k to completely pay off my credit card debt that I took out in sept. (I will pay the taxes like I always have.)

Now I only have 1.17 bitcoin leftover. As of right now, it's worth about 80k. It bothers me deeply though because my 1.57 used to be worth over $111,000. And now I only have 80k. It's gut wrenching.

**QUESTIONS**:

Was it a GOOD idea of me to pay off the 25k debt by selling at 65k? Or do you think I pulled out too early?

Do you think I should've waited until September to pay off the debt to take advantage of the 0% interest for a couple more months? (The reason I didn't do this was because I was worried there was a chance bitcoin price might be lower in september than it is now) (although everyone thinks its going to go up over the next couple of months)

Do you think it was a bad move of me to sell bitcoin right now considering the fact that we just had a bitcoin halving and everyone is saying bitcoin is going to go up?

I understand it's never wise to take out debt to invest, but IF you were to just re-wind back to september and You from the future time traveled to talk to your september self and they told you to balance transfer credit cards to buy bitcoin, would you do it?",2024-05-24 23:55:32

Overly complicated trading strategies will get most people wrecked trading Bitcoin,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ctkece/overly_complicated_trading_strategies_will_get/,10,"I wanted to share something that has completely changed my trading strategy and results. A few months ago, I came across a pro trader who mentioned that the flag pattern is the only thing you need to make money in any financial market. Intrigued, I decided to give it a try, and I have to say, it’s been more useful than anything else I've tried.

Here's what I've been doing:

1. **Weekly Time Frame**: I focus on the weekly time frame to identify flag patterns. This longer time frame helps filter out the noise and gives a clearer picture of the market trend.
2. **Spot the Flag**: Whenever I see a flag pattern forming, I make a note of it. For those who don't know, a flag pattern usually consists of a strong price movement (the flagpole) followed by a consolidation phase that forms the flag itself. The breakout from this consolidation phase often signals a continuation of the initial trend.
3. **Trade in the Direction of the Flag**: Once I identify a flag pattern, I trade in the direction of the breakout. If it's an upward flag, I go long; if it's downward, I short.

I cannot believe how much capital I wasted before discovering this simple yet powerful strategy. It has significantly improved my trading outcomes and confidence.

If you’re struggling with your trading strategy, I highly recommend giving the flag pattern a try. Has anyone else had similar success with this or any other simple trading strategies?",2024-05-16 18:47:45
Why should I not sell the spot bitcoin etf for bitcoin futures that yields 23%?,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ctk5ac/why_should_i_not_sell_the_spot_bitcoin_etf_for/,61,"
I’m holding a bit of both now and I’m thinking BITO (bitcoin futures etf) is almost too good to be true. It gives you a 23% (annualized) dividend payed out each month, AND it seems to follow the price of bitcoin very well. Somebody tell me how this isn’t too good to be true and better than the spot etf.

I held 100 shares of BITO (it’s currently at $26 a share) for one month and got a pay out of $162. If I were to convert more of my bitcoin holdings to it, I could pay my bills with that dividend! That dividend would be killer even just in fiat, but with the gains of bitcoin? Too good.

I take it the catch is that it slips a few percent below the gains of actual bitcoin (and I know, there’s no replacement for cold storage. I have cold storage as well). The fee is almost 1% but again, that’s nothing for a 23% payout. 

If anyone has any resources to better understand how this etf works or can come up with some compelling reasons why not to hold it instead of bitcoin, I’d love to hear. (P.S. I only respond to nice language)",2024-05-16 18:37:18

Virtual money market on bitcoin exchange using offsetting bots?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1csa9w1/virtual_money_market_on_bitcoin_exchange_using/,6,"I'm trying to find reasons this will blow up ...

I started an experiment with 10x leverage, $500 each [market volatility and bot requirements resulted in slight parameter differences]

Long entry 62.6 min 57.8 max 68.8 liq 49.9

Short 62.5 / 58  / 67 / 69.7

24 hrs:  
long -17.9 Unrealized, +2.7 Grid, -0.05 Funding 

short 21.5 / 6.3 / 0.03

Aggregate [$1,000] 3.6 / 9.0 / -0.02
Grid profit ""interest"" over 300%/yr (simple)
Assume reversed unrealized pnl -3.6 ""intetest"" is 200%, if unrealized components skewed to 2x disparity (-7.2) ""interest"" would be 100%

Obviously this can't work. Why?

The intent is finding a neutral place for trading assets on  exchange  in an uncertain trend/crab.  The equivalent of putting traditional assets in money market.

If one side approached liquidation both would be closed 

Edit: I'll update the results until the worst case aggregate bot return (grid - absolute value of L+S - AV funding) is negative or downvotes erase all my karma.

"Is it ""OK"" (""Safe"") to buy Bitcoin on Interactive Brokers (Stock Broker mainly)...?
",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1cmsi5u/is_it_ok_safe_to_buy_bitcoin_on_interactive/,9,"Hello

I have a new IB (Interactive Brokers) account (on the Ireland ""branch"", im not from Ireland but I am from Europe). I have Cash account, default currency is USD.

Can i ""safely"" buy Bitcoin on IB...? I mean, im pretty sure i cannot withdraw actual bitcoin that i bought through Interactive brokers, but other than that it should be ""completely safe"" and normal....? Like its normal spot bitcoin right...? No futures or derivatives or whatever, just ""basic simple bitcoin"".



I saw that when you buy BTC through IB (im using the web user interface, not mobile and not the desktop app, just the default web interface) you buy via ""Paxos""... Im not familiar with them... Is it some sort of crypto exchange...? I know coinbase, bitfinex, kraken, okcoin, Binance etc. I never heard of Paxos... Is it an exchange...? Is it ""safe exchange""...? Like they (Paxos) buy and ""store"" (""custodian"") for IB, right...? What if paxos ""dies"" like FTX etc...? Will Interactive brokers fully compensate me for the bitcoin i might lose with paxos if it goes under...?

Simple and overall... What is Paxos and is it safe to buy BTC via Interactive Brokers (which use Paxos)...?



Thank you",2024-05-08 01:29:02
There are 3 simple ways to buy so that you are contributing to the upward price of Bitcoin,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1cmporq/there_are_3_simple_ways_to_buy_so_that_you_are/,15,"Three ways:

1. Buy on any exchange **and withdraw to a wallet.** Not withdrawing means exchanges technically do not even have to own the Bitcoin to support your buys. They are not buying more just because you gave them money for Bitcoin. Leaving coins on an exchange also risks a total loss with no recourse.
2. If you don't want to hold our own keys, and I recommend you do, then just buy the ETFs. Unlike exchanges, the ETFs are legally required to buy the Bitcoin you give them money for at a 1:1 ratio.
3. Buying peer to peer (Bisq etc.) and hold your own keys. 

These are 3 easy ways to contribute to the upward price of Bitcoin. Buying and leaving on an exchange does not help anyone, especially not yourself.",2024-05-07 23:10:49

Overall, thar part of my crypto account is down about 9.5%.

I know normally not to buy high and sell low, but cashing in at a loss and repusrchasing at a $9,000 difference would make more money in the long run?

i have been seeing this trend where the price on bitcoin dips to around 61,000 at 5 am and 63,000 at 5 pm (give or take a few hours and a few 1000 dollars).

thats about 3.28 percent increase.

say the maker, taker and transaction fees  in total is around 1 percent (i use kraken btw)

that is 2.28% increase of a bitcoin which is 1.4k$.

that is 1.4k$ profit 

the obvious answer i expect is market is volatile, what if it dips instead of increasing but based on trends its not that likely and even if it does bitcoin is very likely to recover the only tradeoff would be more waiting time

please someone tell me its stupid and explain why this wouldnt actually work other than the obvious i pointed out

1) Taking out a HELOC at 9% interest to invest in Bitcoin
Or
2) Opening a Kraken Margin Account to play a 5x leverage to buy additional Bitcoin. Kraken says the fee is only 0.02% so this would seem the better choice?

Can Bitcoin keep self-sovereignty (be your own bank) without a blocksize increase?,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ccbatq/can_bitcoin_keep_selfsovereignty_be_your_own_bank/,119,"I have been doing a bit of a deep-dive into the mechanics and issues around scalability for Bitcoin and was wondering if anyone had thoughts on this question.

My concern is that for all the L2s that are being proposed, it seems baked into these assumptions is that most people (>99% of world population) will not be working directly on the base chain and so will not actually own any UTXOs. This will mean that they do not ""own their keys, own their coins"" so will be beholden to the goodwill of someone else to be their bank. They will lack self-sovereignty and the freedom to be their own bank which is an important part of what Bitcoin and crypto is all about.

For us here who got in early we may not see this as a problem. But for adopting new users it is very problematic because noone wants to be a ""2nd class citizen"" of the Bitcoin network. We all want that freedom granted to us to control our money and not be beholden to an institution.

I personally believe that if Bitcoin is not able to give people the ability to be their own bank as traditionally envisioned by Satoshi, it will leave a spot open in the market for a competitor cryptocurrency that gives people this. I know I would want it and most people I talk to would want it as well.

Anyone have any thoughts on this? Like I said my major concern is that people seem to think Bitcoin has already ""won"" in the marketplace and I think that is far from the truth. There are big issues around throughput on the network, high fees which will prevent users from low-medium income countries from using the network, and now it appears that even self-sovereignty will only be available for early adopters or the already wealthy who can buy large amounts.

This seems to me to be a major threat to the overall value proposition that Bitcoin claims to represent and will leave room for a competitor or multiple competitors to move in and replace it. There are already existing PoW coins that are trying to do this (the biggest being LTC/XMR/BCH) and I'm sure there could be more in the future.

What is the solution here for Bitcoin? Does another discussion around increasing blocksize need to occur? Will self-sovereignty be a part of the future Bitcoin network? What impact could this have on the overall demand for Bitcoin in the longrun?

I think these questions are relevant in BTCmarkets because they relate to the entire value proposition that in the longterm will drive Bitcoin adoption and price growth.

**EDIT: I thought I'd add here my own holdings. >80% of Crypto networth in BTC. Remaining 20% in LTC/BCH/XMR. So I have a lot to lose here too, I'm not a bagholder for something else and trying to shill it. I'm trying to protect my own investment in BTC but have hedged into other coins because I think so long as they are PoW they can still end up on top.**

Exchanges that support SD IRA LLC,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1cbws5m/exchanges_that_support_sd_ira_llc/,5,"I created a self-directed IRA and checkbook LLC end of last year and bought some bitcoin through Kraken Pro. I now want to buy some alt coins, but I’m a little concerned about the Taxi implications

I’m trying to find a crypto exchange that will let me make sure the account holder is the LLC. I tried Coinbase institutional but they only have two accounts and you have to check the box saying you  will maintain a $500,000 balance. I’m using self custody so I won’t be doing this and I’ve also invested a large percentage of my retirement in bitcoin.

Anyone know an exchange that will let me set up an account in the name of the LLC ?

Thanks

High fees post halving,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1c8m6kn/high_fees_post_halving/,6,"Conspiracy mode: ON

As you probably noticed fees are so high that block reward is approximately 19btc.

Last days/weeks/months was discovery that the majority of pools are sending they coinbase reward output to the same place.

In you opinion this can be the goal of the pools? Do they want to keep higher fees with fake transactions (however the fees goes back to them) or it's my imagination?

However this pool centralization is quite bad and can lead to some new tipe of attack that would make the network very unusable to almost everyone.

How much bitcoin miners earned in February vs after the Halving today,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1c8jjs0/how_much_bitcoin_miners_earned_in_february_vs/,10,"On Feb 5, 2024, bitcoin miners on Nicehash were earning .00000174 BTC per terahash per day, or $0.0745 USD per terahash per day. The bitcoin price was $42,816 USD.  
  
As of April 19, 2024, miners earn 0.00000192 BTC per terahash per day, or $0.123 per terahash per day. The bitcoin price is $64,154 USD.  
  
So, fees have gone up enough that miners are actually earning more bitcoin now than February. I had a feeling that miners weren't actually making half as much after factoring in fees. Still, the amount of bitcoin minted per day is cut in half.  
  
See for yourself on nicehash, but it doesn't have historical tracking - I just made a note of it in February.",2024-04-20 06:53:57

Bitcoin is more secure than your cash and bank. It isn't bound to a single government, it is owned by normal people like you and I who give it value. When something bad happens people should BUY not SELL because bitcoin is SECURE, can be transferred at anytime and is not tracked. Are you gonna use cash when your government is in a crisis? No, you use bitcoin because it isn't just paper which can be printed until infinity. Yesterday Iran launched some drones at Israel as a response to the bombardment of it's embassy in Syria. Think about it, it isn't even like WW3 is going to happen, and if it does are you going to use your paper money which inherently only has value because the government tells you so? Bitcoin should be pumping during uncertainty or crisis, not dumping. It's an uncontrolled, safe alternative for cash and a no weight alternative for gold which can't just be stolen from you like the cash and gold.",2024-04-14 10:51:26

Bitcoin vs Microstrategies ,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1c00phw/bitcoin_vs_microstrategies/,29,"As the title suggests, what are you opinions on Microstrategies as a proxy investment to Bitcoin?

Long story short I have an investment grandfathered in through a TFSA ETF doing well with Bitcoin. This cycle id love to try and sell some and lock in profits, but the issue is if I do so I will not be able to buy back in through my tax free savings account to crypto. Only 10% of my portfolio can be crypto unless it’s grandfathered it from before. I’m currently at about 90%. Microstrategies is currently overlooked however…but I really don’t know if that’s a similar enough investment to take opportunity.

I have a couple options 

1. Hold my Bitcoin through all the ups and downs for long term and have it all tax free gains

2. Sell portions to get profits hoping to buy back into Microstrategies at a lower price and build more up along the way

3. Sell all for a really solid profit, hold that until the price comes back down in the next sip and buy real Bitcoin for cold storage, but then any gains I will be hit with capital gains tax going forward



Any advice?

Cryptominer and the next 10+X  month,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1bzmhw6/cryptominer_and_the_next_10x_month/,4,"Hi all, i hope this is not too much offtopic but i am really asking myself why the crypto mining stocks are  doing so badly. When you do a small research then the most frequently mentioned reason is the halving and and the resulting halving of the reward for miners. But there was no difference in the past halving situations except the new bitcoin etf's which could be the reason for a different cashflow. I think the cryptomining stocks could be much higher after the halving when the BTC-Price is high enough so that the mining is worthwhile. What do you think? ",2024-04-09 07:49:04

GBTC Outflows,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1byztfa/gbtc_outflows/,27,"We can clearly see that since market open today the price has started to decline. I suspect this to be mostly GBTC sells. Last I checked they custody about 330,000 BTC. That's HALF of what they had mid January when the ETFs opened. That's nearly 100,000 BTC being sold every month! I can't imagine their entire holdings get sold, in fact i'm surprised we're already at the 50% figure. If they continue to sell at this rate they will be done by June/July.

Let's see how the having treats this whole thing in the next 3 to 6 weeks..

Interesting stuff going on.",2024-04-08 14:50:49

I read that GBTC and ARKB have massive outflows, but is the share price affected by this in any way?

Coinbase issues. Please help!,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1bvj2ka/coinbase_issues_please_help/,11,"Hi. Please excuse if I cross post this but I wanted to reach out to the general community for advice. I am owed funds by Celsius and I would like to receive them in crypto, but Coinbase flagged my account and I cannot receive or withdraw from them until I send them various proof of funds documentation. This happened about 18 months ago and I have been in a protracted battle with them ever since. They sent me a list and I supplied ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING they requested, which was really hard as it went back years. I have a case file about a mile long, with me sending more docs and pleading with them for feedback as to what is missing. I opened a complaint file about a month ago. Last week I received a mail saying that I still have not provided the documents, with no explanation as to what is required - and with the additional kicker that they now consider the case closed. What should I do? I cannot seem to speak to a human being. It's all automated. Is it worth hiring a lawyer? Does anyone have experience in this area, or have any advice for me? If Coinbase will not process my claim, then I will be 'reimbursed' in the dollar amount of the settlement date in January, which is much lower than the crypto is worth today. It feels like I am being double scammed. Cheers, everyone.",2024-04-04 09:43:12

In honour of all the ""Bitcoin's price will be ..... and here is why"", and a quiet Sunday afternoon in search of hopium, here you go. This is not financial advice. Anything you do is your own responsibility. Losses, including but not limited to savings, your wife (or other SO), etc., are your responsibility.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/JT6eCNw7/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JT6eCNw7/)

History rhymes, right?

The important facts are:

* Bitcoin breaks the ATH-to-bear-market-bottom 0.786 retracement 700 days after the final bear market capitulation.
* The time to ATH from the start of the bull market is around 914 days
* The ATH is at or a bit above the 2.272 retracement
* Covid19 mangled the 2017 to 2021 cycle (more of this later).

In the 2013 to 2017 cycle the final bear market capitulation was Jan 2015, and the 0.786 was broken in Dec 2016 which is 700 days later. The bull market starts about Sep 2015 and the ATH follows about 850 days later at the 2.214 retracement.

In the 2017 to 2021 cycle the final bear market capitulation was Nov 2018 (it dropped a bit further but Nov was the killer month), and the 0.786 was broken in Oct 2020 which is 700 days later (it was touched in Jun 2019 but pulled back). The bull market starts about Apr 2019 (the April Fool's day candle) and the ATH follows about 914 days later (so a bit longer).

**But**, the top is lower, what happened? Covid19 happened. After the price crash in Mar 2020, price recovered, then the money printers started as governments round the world tried to fix the total cluster f\*\*k which were the pandemic lockdowns. The result was a whole lot of people ended up with surplus fiat - think the laptop classes with stimulus cheques or furlough payments, with much less opportunity to spend, and so on. So, pay off some debt, save some fiat, invest .... and take a punt on crypto, it's free money after all. When the bull market really took hold, a lot of retail was already way in profit, so much less FOMO.

So, what should the top have been? Well, it should have been over 200K: the 2.272 retracement is at 210K give-to-take.

Now, lets look at the current cycle. The capitulation event is Jun 2022 (Terra/Luna collapse - the FTX crash is not the same), so the 0.786 retracement break should not have been until May 2024 - but it has happened, in Feb 2024.

Well, rather than say ""this time is different on account of the ETFs"", which means two ""different"" events (Covid19 and the ETFs) lets apply Occam's Razor, and assume only one ""different"" event, namely the one that has already happened, Covid19. In that case, we adjust the 2021 to 2025 cycle retracement to set the top at 216K which would be the 2.272 retracement ""top"" on the prior cycle plus a bit. This looks about right, the 0.786 retracement is now at about 115K which looks plausible given the current momentum.

In that case, the next ATH will be around Jul 2015 (912 days from the capitulation) and at around 940K (the 2.272 retracement).

So, there you have it. Feel free to congratulate me, or deride me, July next year.",2024-03-24 15:30:49

What would happen if all the miners left?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1bm2poi/what_would_happen_if_all_the_miners_left/,4,"With the halving coming soon, rewards for miners will decrease by 50%. With Bitcoin already demanding extreme energy resources, one can only assume some miners will not see it profitable to keep mining Bitcoin and either just up and quit or have to file for 11.

  
What would happen in the situation there are no miners left to process transactions on the Blockchain? Would the value of Bitcoin cave in or would the value of Bitcoin go to infinity? I mean if the supply was stopped that would be bullish for the price, because no new Bitcoin would be being mined...

  
But - if there were no miners left to process transactions on the Blockchain - nobody would be able to sell. Bitcoin would become like many other crypto projects such as AABB Gold token where even if you submit KYC applications with your social security number to validate you are who you are, there would be nobody to buy your Bitcoin and nobody to process the transaction or even facilitate a means of being able to sell your Bitcoin at all.

  
You would be trapped holding a bag worth infinity. And the hash rate would be so complicated that you would probably have to spend an infinite amount of money to hash the transaction to sell it.",2024-03-23 20:56:44
Btc as collateral for futures trading on Kraken,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1blvt1i/btc_as_collateral_for_futures_trading_on_kraken/,11,"Hi,

I don't own any Fiat and would like to leverage my Btc stack as trading collateral. I used to trade on Bitmex for this reason, but with the recent Wick to 9k on Bitmex, I no longer feel safe leverage trading there. The only other exchange I trust in terms of security is Kraken. Is it possible to trade futures on Kraken with Btc as collateral?

Any general tips for this endeavor?

Bitcoin vs Tech Stocks: Is Bitcoin really as risky as the SEC says?,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1bd6k5n/bitcoin_vs_tech_stocks_is_bitcoin_really_as_risky/,27,"On the 10th January 2024, history was made when the SEC granted the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the USA. The SEC was reluctant to approve the ETFs because, if you take them for their word, they wish to protect investors from speculative assets and losing money. So their statement of approval contained words of caution: “bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset.” and “Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto”.

In this post I want to focus on the SEC’s warning that Bitcoin, and crypto in general, is a high risk investment. In isolation, that statement may be true. But plenty of tradable assets, approved by the SEC, are also considered ‘risky’. I couldn’t find SEC statements warning against investing in specific assets besides Bitcoin. So the implication here is that Bitcoin is especially risky, to the extent that investors should be warned against it so they do not lose money.

As a fun and informative exercise, I made four comparisons to highlight the relative risk of bitcoin vs tech stocks:

1. The worst investments anyone could have made ever

1. The worst investments from the most recent market crash

1. The largest market cap loss

1. ROI loss per day, historically and recently

This is a long post and I want to point out that if you appreciate clear data and objective analysis you might want to check out [DefiDive.com](https://defidive.com). This is a crypto price, news and asset management terminal that I have built. For now, think of it like Coinmarketcap with less clutter and distractions.

The worst investment possible in Bitcoin returned a -91% ROI and in Ethereum -93% ROI. In contrast, the ‘least worst’ investment is Alphabet with -65% ROI, the median investment is  Nvidia with -87% ROI, and the worst investment possible is Peoloton with -98% ROI. Bitcoin and Ethereum have produced bad losses for anyone buying the top and selling the bottom, but other tech stocks (Amazon, AMD, Peloton) have delivered worse ROI for unlucky investors.

It is worth noting that the market cap of Bitcoin in 2011 was $173MM vs Google in 2007 was $231B. In other words, Bitcoin was worth 0.07% of Google. Comparing Bitcoin’s market crash vs publicly traded tech stocks puts Bitcoin at a disadvantage because these tech stocks only have tradable shares once the company has grown to be large enough to list on a stock market. For example, Google was founded six years before becoming a publicly traded stock in 2004. Bitcoin became publicly tradable within a year of creation and Ethereum was publicly tradable from the moment it was launched. Ultimately we are comparing Bitcoin at age two years old, Ethereum three years old, and Google nine years old. It is reasonable to expect higher volatility from newer and smaller assets.

| Peloton | Dec-2020 | Feb-2024 | $167.37 | $3.96 | $2 | -98% |

Instead of using data from an asset’s entire history, this table compares the worst investments possible during the most recent market crash. All of the assets reached their respective bubble tops and market crashes at slightly different times, and Peloton might not have bottomed out yet. Bitcoin was the sixth worst asset and Ethereum was the third. This tells the same narrative that crypto investments can produce bad returns, but not necessarily much different from tech stocks.

To avoid penalising assets just for being small, comparing the maximum market cap lost is another useful perspective. Amazon is the only asset to lose over $1 Trillion in value. Ethereum performs better than an average for the first time in this analysis. The ranking of this table suggests Bitcoin is comparable to Big Tech, while Ethereum is comparable to the large cap tech.

By none of the measures studied so far has Bitcoin or Ethereum performed the worst. Some might argue that perhaps the risk in crypto comes from the speed at which an investor might lose money. So the following analysis looks at ROI % loss per day during market crashes.

**4. ROI Loss per Day: Crypto vs Tech Stocks** 

All-time worst market crash comparison:

Asset | Start Date | Crash Length (Days) | Average % change per Day 
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
| Microsoft | Dec-1999 | 3350 | -0.02% |
| AMD | Jan-2006 | 3530 | -0.03% |
| Apple | Mar-2000 | 1126 | -0.07% |
| Zoom | Nov-2020 | 1064 | -0.08% |
| Peloton | Dec-2020 | 1157 | -0.08% |
| Amazon | Apr-1999 | 884 | -0.11% |
| Alphabet (GOOGL) | Oct-2007 | 397 | -0.16% |
| Netflix | May-2011 | 458 | -0.17% |
| Meta | Aug-2021 | 426 | -0.18% |
| Tesla | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.19% |
| Ethereum | Jan-2018 | 334 | -0.28% |
| Nvidia | Dec-2001 | 274 | -0.32% |
| Bitcoin | Jun-2011 | 153 | -0.60% |

Bitcoin lost -0.60% per day (average, non-compounding) during the 2011 crash. Which is almost twice as the next worst asset, Nvidia. However, we already established that Bitcoin was so small in 2011 that we aren’t making a fair comparison here. In the most recent market crash, Bitcoin’s ROI loss per day was -0.21%, which is similar to other tech stocks (see next table below)

Most recent market crash comparison:

Asset | Start Date | Crash Length (Days) | Average % change per Day 
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
| Zoom | Nov-2020 | 1064 | -0.08% |
| Peloton | Dec-2020 | 1157 | -0.08% |
| Apple | Dec-2021 | 365 | -0.08% |
| Alphabet (GOOG) | Oct-2021 | 426 | -0.10% |
| Microsoft | Dec-2021 | 304 | -0.12% |
| Amazon | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.14% |
| Meta | Aug-2021 | 426 | -0.18% |
| Tesla | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.19% |
| AMD | Nov-2021 | 334 | -0.20% |
| Bitcoin | Nov-2021 | 365 | -0.21% |
| Nvidia | Nov-2021 | 304 | -0.22% |
| Netflix | Oct-2021 | 243 | -0.31% |
| Ethereum | Nov-2021 | 242 | -0.32% |

In the most recent crash Ethereum lost -0.32% per day (average non-compounding). That is clearly the worst result here, but only one percentage point worse than Netflix. It is somewhat impressive that Zoom and Peloton have the lowest average ROI loss per day, but that is limited comfort to investors if the stock price never recovers. Objectively, with Ethereum already rebounding from $1.1K in Dec-22 to $3.9K in Mar-24, Ethereum has been a better investment than Peloton even if you did get rekt along the way.

**Conclusion**

Out of everything I have studied (not all of which made it into the final cut of this blog post), I find this graph the most useful for summarising potential losses when investing in crypto and tech stocks:

https://i.imgur.com/akl87Jk.png

Looking back at the SEC’s statement, it does seem unfair to single Bitcoin out as a volatile asset when Bitcoin performed similarly to commonly traded tech stocks during the most recent market crash. It feels like the SEC statement is talking about Bitcoin’s volatility as if it is 2011. If we were to take the SEC’s statement as gospel, we would expect this analysis to show Bitcoin and Ethereum are significantly more risky than tech stocks. Instead Bitcoin performed similarly to other tech stocks during the recent market crash and Ethereum performed not much worse. 

**A Sidenote on Beta**

Beta is a measure of an asset's correlation to the broader market. This can be used as a proxy for measuring risk. Tech stocks have become so large that they effectively become ‘the broader market’. You can see below they all have betas close to one. In other words, if big tech share prices go up (or down), so does the S&P 500. Crypto has little correlation to the S&P 500, partly because it has outperformed it over the past 14 years. This gives crypto a beta close to 0, which effectively means anything or nothing could happen when the S&P 500 rises or falls. The beta for crypto has increased since 2020 but it is still far away from other tech stocks. In practice, this means that crypto could be considered as a method to diversify away from tech stocks / S&P 500. Ironically, you could make the argument that this helps lower the overall risk of a portfolio if someone invests sensibly into crypto to achieve more diversification.

Asset | Beta | Interpretation |
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
| Ethereum | 0.08 | The asset’s price movements are independent of market movements. |
| Bitcoin | 0.20 | The asset’s price movements are independent of market movements. |
| Microsoft | 0.95 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |
| Alphabet (GOOGL) | 1.05 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |
| Apple | 1.06 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |
| Amazon | 1.12 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |
| Netflix | 1.15 | If the market goes up or down by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to move in the same direction by a similar percentage. |
| Meta | 1.34 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |
| Zoom | 1.36 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |
| AMD | 1.48 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |
| Nvidia | 1.78 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |
| Tesla | 1.95 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |
| Peloton | 2.84 | If the market increases by a certain percentage, the asset’s price is expected to increase by a higher percentage, and vice versa. |",2024-03-12 19:46:01

Is $69k a major psychological barrier-point due to being the previous ATH?,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1bboz42/is_69k_a_major_psychological_barrierpoint_due_to/,48,"I say yes.

It intuitively feels like the market is going sideways at \~$65-69k because this was the previous ATH and so people are unsure what to do here. Many are selling, buyers have hesitated.

Yet my sense is that once we clearly break through $70k and hit \~$75k or so, we'll be flirting with $100k in no time.

Once this psychological hurdle is crossed, there will be a fresh sense of ""Bitcoin is off to the races, surging to new unknown heights,"" and many will pile on the bandwagon.

BTC price estimate with real analysis 🧮,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1bakmgk/btc_price_estimate_with_real_analysis/,60,"🧮 I have an answer for the future price (2025 year end) of BTC with real FACTs/statistics/analysis/numbers:

Analysts from BOA estimated that $93 million USD are needed to increase the price of BTC 1%. [Source - Bloomberg (2021)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/have-93-million-you-may-be-able-to-boost-bitcoin-s-price-by-1)

So far, we have had (since ETFs inception) $6 billion inflows, that made the price jump from $38,000 to $70,000 (validates exactly BoA analysis ✅). 

You can EASILY calculate future price by increasing the BTC price 1% every $93 million added net inflow.

It is estimated that GOLD ETFs (Global) have $200b net assets in custody worldwide (World Gold Council). 

It is also estimated BTC ETFs assets in custody will get to $150 billion by 2025, that would be $100 billion more inflows added to current total assets in US (just US) ETFs (Grayscale still the largest). [Source (Nasdaq) ](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/spot-bitcoin-etfs-will-see-%24150b-inflows-by-end-of-2025-says-investment-professional%3A#:~:text=Smart%20Investing-,Spot%20Bitcoin%20ETFs%20Will%20See%20%24150B%20Inflows%20By%20End,Investment%20Professional%3A%20'Remarkable'%20Demand&text=Ric%20Edelman%2C%20founder%20of%20the,by%20the%20end%20of%202025.)

Let's do the math for just $50 billion inflows (half of what is estimated 2025). 

💻 If you input this to ChatGpt 4.0:

""An asset needs inflows of $93,000,000 USD to raise 1%. It is currently trading at 70,000 usd per unit and has a market cap of $1,300,000,000,000. With new inflows of $50,000,000,000 what would be its price per unit?"" 

RESULTS:

With the new inflows of $50,000,000,000, the price per unit of the asset would increase to approximately $446,344.09 USD.

Everyone is expecting bitcoin to continue higher from here.

EVERYONE.

This makes you stop and think. Could we all be wrong?

Let's entertain the idea, for a moment, that this is the top.

Even if that's the case, the bottom of bitcoin has been rising non stop:

Which means that over the long term, everything is going according to plan.

Also, DCA'ing bitcoin still continues to outperform pretty much everything:

In reality, bull markets are deviations to the upside, but then bitcoin returns to its trend, which is a long term rise.

So relax and enjoy the ride.

Understanding the motives behind FUD,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1b7rkzf/understanding_the_motives_behind_fud/,7,"The higher the price of Bitcoin climbs, the more FUD we should expect to see.  Keep in mind: the people spreading FUD don't necessarily believe what they're saying.  They often have ulterior motives.  Here's a perfect example.

Jim Cramer was doing a small on camera interview that he never thought anyone would see.  He admitted creating false information to cause the price of certain stocks to drop.

> Cramer: ""A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund, and I was position short, meaning I needed it down, I would create a level of activity before hand that could drive the futures. It doesn't take much money.""

> Cramer: ""Now you can't foment. That's a violation of, of...""

> Interviewer: ""Ferment?""

> Cramer: ""You can't FOment. You can't create, yourself, an impression that a stock's down. But you do it anyway because the SEC doesn't understand it. So, I mean that's the only sense I would say this is illegal.""

Here's the whole thing:

Fuck Jim Cramer, [Part 1: ""How the hell did we end up here?""](https://www.cc.com/video/fttmoj/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-exclusive-jim-cramer-extended-interview-pt-1)

Fuck Jim Cramer, [Part 2: Cramer Admits Fraud and ""Roll 212""](https://www.cc.com/video/iinzrx/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-jim-cramer-pt-2)

Fuck Jim Cramer, [Part 3: ""What is the responsibility of people who cover Wall Street?""](https://www.cc.com/video/gliow5/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-jim-cramer-pt-3)

At one point in the interview, Jon Stewart showed Cramer video of himself (Cramer) admitting to committing fraud.  In the video Steward showed Cramer, Cramer said: ""...that's the part that's illegal"" and ""...I'm not gonna say that on TV.""

Cramer's response: ""It's on TV now!""

Cramer is a fraud.  Always has been, always will be.

In this example, Cramer wasn't talking about Bitcoin.  But he was explaining how he, and others like him, spread lies to force prices lower (so he can profit).

Remember: When you see Bitcoin FUD, the person spreading it probably doesn't even believe what he's saying.

"Microstrategy, proxy for US investors to buy options on bitcoin?",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1b6r5ls/microstrategy_proxy_for_us_investors_to_buy/,4,"Hello,

It is very difficult for US retail investors to buy options on BTC (LedgerX has pretty lousy volume). I was wondering does anyone here like to buy options on MSTR. Basically MSTR is just a firm that holds bitcoin, so that means options on their company behave (in theory due to no arbitrage) like bitcoin options?",2024-03-05 00:26:25
For someone who has seen 3 cycles I’m calling tops (for now),16,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1b6nd43/for_someone_who_has_seen_3_cycles_im_calling_tops/,113,"Hey YALL,

First I’d like to say my spidey senses are tingling  and the alarm bells are ringing on overtime; and I’m calling the top here (within this 72 hour period). The bitcoin top has been breached at 67.8k, and if another big day it’ll be 68.9kish by Wednesday which will mark the absolute top. For the first time in ages I have begun to take profits and rebalanced after buying heavy bags at 16-22k just in 2022. 

For the first time ever I have arranged bitcoin shorts. Before anyone asks I rebalanced a small portion and am a bitcoin maxi. 

I’ve seen and been apart of each bitcoin since  bull and bear market of 2013. I know this post may not be popular and for many will hope I am wrong which I understand. Believe me I made many mistakes in my time. Please use cold storage, have dry powder ready, and do NOT ape into meme coins.. you’ll get through this. 

This run has been impressive no doubt, and this rally is similar but more extreme than the 2019 bull trap.

The real winners will be the ones who don’t panic sell and buy bitcoin when it’s in the low 40’s this summer. Bitcoin will at least test the 200W. Remember 25-30% corrections is normal even in bull runs.

However I would like for those to exercise caution (especially for those who have yet to experience the ups and downs in this market. Every indicator is screening this is the biggest bull trap possibly ever. Yes I get ETF’s are out and “this time is different” but remember as fast as retail and institutions buy they can sell. It is different per se in testing ATH before the halving, but the real bull market begins later this year. 

Once the FED begins to cut rates this summer the market will drop and experience heavy volatility. The real euphoria will begin. 12-18 months with QE and liquidity. This was a mere warm up.

Doesn’t mean I am a bear. I am an ultra bitcoin maxi, however short term we have hit tops for bitcoin within this cycle pre halving. I’ll see you late 2025-2026 when BTC is >150k. By 2029-2032 over 1m. 

The real bull market begins back in October, I will hibernate till then. You can remind me anytime in the summer if I was right or not.  Retail FOMO always gets burned. Be careful out there.

I’m here to answer and support. ",2024-03-04 21:53:42
Step out of your online bubble: we are not at 'euphoria' yet.,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1b6fyc6/step_out_of_your_online_bubble_we_are_not_at/,42,"I've seen claims that we are already in the full swing of the Euphoria phase of the cycle. This is not true.

[Chart for reference.](https://www.newtraderu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/market-cycle-chart.jpg)

Take in account the fact that what matters is the temperament of the *overall* market. Not this subreddit, your crypto discord, or shills on X calling for huge numbers.

You and your buddies might very well be feeling euphoric, but the retail market is not. The overall market is somewhere between Hope and Optimism right now.

How much does 10% more buy volume move BTC?,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1b6a9f4/how_much_does_10_more_buy_volume_move_btc/,9,"I'm wanting to get an understanding of how much that would move BTC. Does anyone have an idea or can point to an article that shows how this works? The desire was born out of seeing the ETF data, it seems about 2-4 billion is flowing in per day, which is about 10-20% of the buy volume of BTC i think. About 40 billion is traded today, so 20-25 is maybe bought. So 2-4 billion is 10-20% of the probable inflow into the BTC ETF's. Any thoughts on how a 10% higher inflow moves BTC? Does that make it move 3% a day? Or 2%? Or 10%?",2024-03-04 12:56:51

Is this time different??,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1b4upcf/is_this_time_different/,77,"I’ve been researching bitcoin and this bitcoin halving cycle and came to some conclusions. 

Can someone play devils advocate or let me know if I’m wrong on any of these points? I know that there some veterans in this subreddit, and I’m hoping to get some other viewpoints to challenge my thesis: 


1. Nobody has ever lost money holding bitcoin for any rolling 4 year period 

2. In the last phase of each bull market cycle, bitcoin will have parabolic moves up, and then crashes hard, but never significantly goes below the all time high price of the last bull market cycle. For example, bitcoin reached an all time high of 65-70K in 2021, and then crashed 70-80% to around 16K in 2022 only for only a few weeks, but never stayed below the 20K all time high from 2017 for long. The 20K all time high from 2017 was basically the floor for the next cycle 

If the 2021 high for bitcoin was 65-70K then that will be the floor for this bitcoin cycle. Bitcoin will have parabolic moves after this bitcoin halving event in April 2024, but after it inevitably reaches the next all time high and crashes it will not significantly fall under 65K. 
Anyone buying bitcoin at today’s prices will not lose money in the next Bear market and there’s still a large margin of safety 

3. What sets this bitcoin cycle apart from any other previous cycle is that SEC approved, regulated bitcoin spot ETFs exist now. Every previous cycle consisted of only retail investors, but now institutional investors have a regulated way to buy bitcoin. The institutional money should make bitcoin less volatile. 

As bitcoin reaches higher and higher market caps we would also expect the price to be less volatile just like any maturing asset. 

This bitcoin cycle or some future bitcoin cycle, people are going to expect bitcoin to eventually crash 70-80%, but bitcoin may only crash 20-40% due to institutional money and increasing adoption/awareness. When bitcoin only crashes 20-40% in the upcoming Bear markets then this will cause many traders to stumble, and will be validation for the bitcoin thesis as a mature asset 

Am I wrong on any of the three points above? Is anyone able to challenge my assumptions? I just don’t want to get wrecked next year

"Cautionary Tale: My Experience with Phemex and their KYC ""trap""",30,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1b39k9b/cautionary_tale_my_experience_with_phemex_and/,15,"My experience with phemex. I originally signed up because they don't require KYC. No KYC! Enticing, right?? read on...  
A. I signed up and made a small deposit on phemex. With those funds, i send out small transactions ($5-20) to a bunch of personal crypto wallets. I funded the wallets to buy nfts, coins etc. No issues w/ 20-30+ tx. All tx visible on the block chain - nothing shady.  
B. Things were going well, so I deposited a larger amount of funds a few weeks later and did very similar transactions as before. This time however, i got flagged by ""risk control"" after only a few transactions. Again, nothing shady. Everything traceable on the blockchain etc. Now they have frozen my funds and are requiring ""advanced KYC"" for me to withdraw or move anything. This is bait and switch. They let you deposit without KYC, but require it when you want to withdraw.  
C. They claim my funds were flagged by ""risk control"" because the funds came from ""an unverified source"". I showed them on the block chain the account was funded directly from coinbase.... no reply to that email when i pointed that out. Is coinbase really setting off their fraud detectors?

  
CONCLUSION: DO NOT FALL FOR Phemex's KYC trap! I'm completely stuck as I will not do advanced KYC (i did level 1 Kyc), so I'm making people aware. They lure you in with their ""NO KYC required"", but then seize your funds when you make a larger deposit.  
AVOID PHEMEX. Or at least proceed with extreme caution if you're not willing or able to do advanced KYC.

Tether and Bitcoin,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1atkaa5/tether_and_bitcoin/,31,"There has been a lot of discussion around Tether and its relationship to Bitcoin over the years. Lots of that discussion is to do with whether the printing of Tether (USDT) is responsible for the price rises in Bitcoin. 

There is also considerable speculation that Tether is not backed 1 to 1 with assets which if widely accepted would (presumably) result in a crisis in USDT due to a loss of credibility around the redeemability of Tether for other forms of USD. 

However I have been thinking about this and want to present an argument that even if Tether is not backed 1 to 1 with USD assets it may not lead to a tanking of USDT. There will need to be some degree of backing to maintain confidence in the overall possibility of redemptions but that level is likely not 1 to 1 and could be much lower.

The basis of this claim is what Tether sounds like based on my understanding is fractional reserve banking which is the norm across the entire Trad-Fi banking system. There likely isn't a single widely-known bank in the world that has assets on hand to cover all depositors attempting to withdraw their funds at once and in this regard Tether is no different. When a currency isn't cryptographically backed (like Bitcoin) then the amount that can be issued by banks/stablecoin issuers is only determined by the amount the market will bear until a loss of credibility leads to enough holders to simultaneously withdraw and causing a bank run or unpegging of the stablecoin.

What is interesting about this to me is that it reconceptualises what Tether/other stablecoins are from being ""crypto"" to effectively being a ""digital first bank that only issues into the defi system"". And in that regard it has all the strengths/weaknesses of a traditional bank. Just as traditional banks can continue to operate without being able to redeem anything close to the entirety of customer funds, Tether can continue to operate even if it turns out that they don't have 1-1 asset backing for USDT.

There are risks to what Tether is doing in the same way banks expose themselves to risk. If too much USDT is ""printed"" too quickly, it could lead to a loss of confidence in Tether and cause the equivalent of a run. This is similar to how if a bank makes too many risky loans and harms their balance sheet they can end up in insolvency and experience a bank run.

The example of Terra/Luna is interesting as a counter-example. The difference with Terra (UST) was that it wasn't backed by USD or equivalent assets. Terra was backed by Luna, another crypto. A stablecoin backed by a volatile crypto has elements of instability baked in that don't exist for a stablecoin like Tether which piggybacks off the trad-fi system and the existing bank infrastructure.

So based on the above, I have come to think that Tether is no more or less likely to ""collapse"" than any bank is likely to collapse. If there is a loss of confidence in the bank/tether for any reason then it could face accelerated withdrawals it can't handle. But if it acts reasonably responsibly (like most banks do) then even if it isn't backed 1 to 1 this isn't an inherent problem for Tether and unlikely to lead to a collapse. 

This post is speculative and I'd like to hear any/all (polite) criticism of my thinking here. I'm sure there is plenty as I'm not sure I understand the whole area myself. I just can't help but notice that the accusation ""Tether isn't fully-backed and so will/should fail"" is not equally applied to Trad-fi banks even though they are in the same position.",2024-02-18 03:18:44

"Is the bull run here or we have to wait till post halving? 
",22,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1as4uew/is_the_bull_run_here_or_we_have_to_wait_till_post/,26,"Last bull saw BTC MCap value around 1.2 trillion dollars with an average daily trading volume ranging from 25-36 billion dollars. 

The current MCap value has exceeded 1 trillion dollars but one could still doubt if the bull run has started cos the MCap is expected to better the previous data to signal the bull run. 

My analysis may not be accurate but could be somehow close. May like to hear from the OGs too.",2024-02-16 09:47:05

BTC 2024/2025 Peak Price Predictions,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1arjmrs/btc_20242025_peak_price_predictions/,49,"Leave your price predictions below.

My prediction is $150,000 based on the following:

&#x200B;

A 30% increase for inflation adjustment Since Oct/Nov 2021:

The $69,000 peak of 2021 is the equivalent of $89,700 today.

\*\*\*\*\*Can only be met if the stock market is also in a state of euphoria. Currently we are not in this state as the S&P 500 P/E ratio is 27.5, P/E ratio was 36 in Oct/Nov 2021.

&#x200B;

A 50% increase for Easier and MUCH SAFER to buy BTC than in 2021

\*\*\*\*\*ETFs have eliminated novel crypto exchanges who mishandle funds, charge ridiculous fees, or require tedious crypto wallet transfers. Furthermore the Average Joe ""hacked my crypto"" stigma is gone with ETFs. Thus attracting the average Joe and Wallstreet

&#x200B;

10% increase due to Higher BTC dominance

\*\*\*\*\*Since crypto ETFs are almost all Bitcoin focused it's likely that BTC dominance will be higher than in past halving cycles. Perhaps BTC layer 2 projects will also be the new hot topic instead of sh1tcoin pumps.",2024-02-15 16:37:00

How hard will diminishing returns impact bitcoin price or will we break away?,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1ah0aji/how_hard_will_diminishing_returns_impact_bitcoin/,68,"  
Hear me out and sorry for the napkin maths.  
  
Previous troughs to peaks for bitcoin have had the following raises.  
  
2012 - 2014 61667%    
2015 - 2018 12959% reduction of 78%  
2019 - 2021 2119%   reduction of 78%  
  
If the next bull run shows another 78% reduction bitcoin would riase from its bear market low by 466%  
2023 $15560 \* 466% > 2025 $72509  
  
That would only give a top of $72,509 which just seems to miniscuale to me, idk maybe I feel the need to compesate.  
  
  
I'm aware of the potential multiplies effect and the cash waiting on the side-lines now the spot ETFs are here.   
  
I read this article on the ETF inflows [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-etf-inflows-in-context](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-etf-inflows-in-context)   
  
Even if we take the $200 million/day daily buying pressure and extrapolate it out it doesn't add up to a lot. That figure includes GBTC selling but let's assume that goes away and the surplus buying reduces to $200 million/day.  
  
$200mill \* 5 days \* 56 weeks =  $56 Billion/ year  
  
Another take is that Blackrock hit $1 billion after 4 days. That's a pretty similar number for yearly in flows.   
($1 billion/4)\* 5 days \* 56 weeks = $70 Billion

That's only one of the ETFS but I'm assuming inflows don't keep that pace each day of the year even with all the ETFs combined.  
  [https://www.reuters.com/technology/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-first-hit-1-bln-assets-2024-01-19/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-first-hit-1-bln-assets-2024-01-19/)

  
If we take that $ 70 billion over the course of a year and add it to the market cap of bitcoin it would barely have an impact.  
  
  
Despite my post I'm bullish but I struggle to see how we reach millions of $ or even $200k. Please highlight the flaws in this line of thinking.",2024-02-02 10:03:31

For a finance project, I am looking to acquire historical call/put data on BTC. In particular I am only interested in End-of-day Quotes, for the entire option chain on that day. I was able to find a good options data from [OptionsDX](https://www.optionsdx.com/product/btc-option-chains/), but it only goes back to 2021 June.  Ideally, the longer the data set I have the better.

Major Moon Math Update: Jane Street and The Great Glass Bitcoin ETF,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/19bh3v3/major_moon_math_update_jane_street_and_the_great/,8,"# End of the First Week with ETFs & market chaos.

Sparkly new ETFs wrapped up their debut week and my chaps have never been more raw.

##Total Net Inflow
New ETFs are breaking records, netting a cool +$1.2 billion, moving past the $4 billion mark.

##GBTC's Twisty Tale
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) dropped a hefty $2.8 billion overall, and on Friday faced a $590 million outflow.

## More Price Stability
A decade ago I got into regular fights with members of this sub about the increasing price stability of bitcoin. And, despite the initial drop we saw last week, I think that is what we're seeing. Are ETFs partially responsible for this? Yes. But what is the mechanism that's taking money from traders? I'm not so sure about this one, but I'm wondering about how Jane Street and other authorized participants (AP) are involved. 

## Jane Street's Influence
These ETFs aren't just numbers on a screen. They're being nudged and wiggled by the likes of Jane Street, the puppet masters of the ETF world. Recall that Sam Bankmanfried left Jane Street to create FTX, and recruited from Jane Street (including his ""CEO/GF"" of Alameda Research)

https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/

Jane Street coordinates the purchase and sale of Bitcoin for multiple ETFs (including [GBTC](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/27/grayscale-lines-up-jane-street-and-virtu-as-authorized-participants-if-gbtc-converts-to-etf/), [Wisdomtree](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/), [IBTC](https://twitter.com/alistairmilne/status/1740822439494287843), and [FBTC](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/)) as an authorized participant. In the context of Bitcoin ETFs, an authorized participant (AP) like Jane Street has several key responsibilities:

#### Creation and Redemption of ETF Shares
Jane Street manages the process of creating and redeeming ETF shares. This involves handling the inflow and outflow of funds from the ETF, which is critical for maintaining the liquidity and stability of the ETF.

#### Overseeing Cash Transfers
As an AP, Jane Street oversees the transfer of cash to and from the ETF's administrator. This is a vital function for ensuring that the ETF operates smoothly and efficiently.

#### Market Liquidity Maintenance
A significant part of an AP's role is to contribute to the liquidity of the ETF in the market. They do this by ensuring that the ETF shares are available for trading and by facilitating the process of share creation and redemption. As a result, Jane Street helps ETFs maintain a market price that is close to the net asset value.

#### Interaction with Market Makers
Jane Street may interact with market makers to ensure that the ETF shares are traded at prices that are close to ""their actual value,"" further contributing to setting the market price.

#### Fulfilling Investor Orders
Jane Street may create or redeem ETF shares in large blocks, known as creation units, which are then exchanged with the ETF for baskets of underlying assets or the equivalent value in cash.

Jane Street's expertise and experience in trading and market-making, especially in the ETF domain, make them a key player in the operational mechanics of Bitcoin ETFs. Their role is integral to the smooth functioning of these ETFs, ensuring that they reflect the price movements of Bitcoin while offering a regulated, stock-exchange-listed investment vehicle for Bitcoin exposure.

#### Does Jane Street control both sides of the trade?
If you look into Jane Street, you know that their focus is on gaming the market to extract maximum value for themselves and they're making a huge amount of money somewhere. If being an AP for ETFs were not providing an ungodly amount of profit, they would not be involved. Also, remember that Jane Street coordinates the purchase and sale of Bitcoin for *multiple* ETFs (including [GBTC](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/27/grayscale-lines-up-jane-street-and-virtu-as-authorized-participants-if-gbtc-converts-to-etf/), [Wisdomtree](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/), [IBTC](https://twitter.com/alistairmilne/status/1740822439494287843), and [FBTC](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jane-street-capital-broker-bitcoin-etfs/)) as an authorized participant. READ, the buy side and sell side are the same entity, **regardless of which ETF you are buying with**.


## The Bigger Picture: U.S. Bitcoin ETFs

The ETFs' story is a starting gun for a new era in crypto, turning Bitcoin into a blue-chip investment. We're talking about a potential influx of $50 billion or more this year alone. almost 100,000 bitcoin have been taken off the market already. And with Bitcoin's market cap hovering over $913 billion, these ETFs will add extreme bullish pressure to the price in the last two quarters of this year.

## In Summary

This isn't just about numbers and charts (and assholes). It's about a seismic shift in the crypto universe. The ETFs are reshaping how we think about Bitcoin and its kin. Are we creating a new mental model about a market that's maturing, evolving--unpredictable as ever (but also, maybe, a little more stable)?

## What's next?

Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure: the crypto market will never be controlled by unprofessional hacks, slinging private keys around on a web server, again.

Good hunting.

Would you think onchain data still effectively reflect the trading activities of spot BTC ETFs?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/195kpf5/would_you_think_onchain_data_still_effectively/,2,"I am just curious if onchain data would be less valuable because of the advent of spot BTC ETFs. My concern is that onchain data might not effetely reflect the trading activities of spot BTC ETFs, while its trading volume would eventually eclipse the real BTC tradings. 

Considering that spot ETFs typically involve buying and selling actual BTCs, often through over-the-counter (OTC) , I'm also curious to know if these OTC transactions are recorded in onchain data.

"ETF and Paper BTC, Potential for Manipulation",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/194dwcp/etf_and_paper_btc_potential_for_manipulation/,17,"So I have been under the impression that All ETF shares that are bought require the ETF to hold the reciprocal amount of the underlying asset (BTC), but my friend who is a tradfi day trader thinks otherwise. He think the language allows for more paper BTC than hard BTC to be traded. 

Is anybody here financially literate and able to cite proof of either of the above? Could they somehow change the language around to allow for more paper BTC to be traded than exists?

Will we know the wallet addresses of these funds so we can easily audit them?

THE END OF THE BTC DREAM,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1948m65/the_end_of_the_btc_dream/,20,"I just returned from a walk in the woods trying to wrap my head around the latest current events of the BTC Protocol.

As much as I looked forward to the spot BTC approval by the SEC the results of this positive approval have shaken my core with a nightmare scenario.

Honest question to myself and anyone who is reading this: Does the success of BTC  improve the position of the Asset Managers who have applied for this spot BTC ETF?

The answer is NO!

Why? BTC moving forward will devalue the US currency while reducing the values of the Assets under Management. This appears to be suicidal without a ulterior motive.

What is the Ulterior motive?  A License to kill btc backed by the US Gov.

What happened on Wednesday with the SEC slip with the Spot BTC approval?

Could it have been a little show and tell showing the SEC what they (Asset Managers) are capable of accomplishing? Call it conspiracy if you wish but its too coincidental for me.

As a BTC Maxi I will not sell my BTC and I will probably have to sell my home as well as a large portion of my (Saylor biz) holdings realizing that anything positive with BTC will be at the mercy of the wall street goons.

Godspeed BTC Maxis and everyone here and please tell me I'm wrong without telling me I'm wrong. Cheers",2024-01-11 18:26:19
Price estimates using the BoA multiplier,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/194358b/price_estimates_using_the_boa_multiplier/,26,"Hi Folks,

Several posts have been using the BoA multiplier as some sort of constant. I wanted to set expectations correctly: As the BTC price increases, the effect of the multiplier decreases.

I wrote up the calculation here: [https://imgur.com/G3to511](https://imgur.com/G3to511) The calculation is straightforward if you remember calculus.

tl;dr  Using the BoA multiplier of 135x, which was valid at $30,000/btc, and all other things being equal (haha), the increase in price (from $47K/btc) looks like:



|$N Billion inflow|Price|
|:-|:-|
|1|$51K|
|3|$59K|
|10|$80K|
|30|$121K|
|100|$209K|



Edit 240212: Added the reference point $47K/btc for the table.

What is the flaw with this 1x short?,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/18rnegh/what_is_the_flaw_with_this_1x_short/,12,"I opened a 1x short with a btc collateral perp. The liquidation price is 1,000,000 (I don't know exactly why, USDT 1x short was under 100,000). 

Funding averages 3%/month from the few months data I have.

Assume 1 btc @ 44k. Rangebound for 1 month, expect to close below 44k and collect funding. 20% break to 53k, close 0.8 btc at 53k  = 42.4k, 3.6% loss covered by funding gain. 

Some sharp reaction post ETF to 40k or less gets 10% more bitcoin for halving party. 

It keeps the degen instinct in check too.

Even an overnight 50% break gives 33k (17%* loss before funding) which would suck. Any other flaws?

*edit 25% which would suck more. A stop loss would have hopefully triggered by a 5% loss (53.7k) before funding.",2023-12-27 00:53:26
1st annual guess the high contest,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/18racz2/1st_annual_guess_the_high_contest/,56,"It's the 1st Annual ""Guess the High"" contest. Here are the rules:

    The time window is 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 UTC to 22 Dec 2024 00:00:00 UTC.
    What is your guess for the highest price during that window? (Price is in US$, and comes from Coinbase.)
    You get one guess.
    Guesses must be messaged to me, NOT sent as a reply to this post.
    Guesses must be in $10 increments, in round $10 amounts (i.e. $39990, $41380, etc.)
    Included with your guess must be the instruction ""higher"" or ""lower"". If your guess has already been entered, your guess will be moved to the next available slot, higher or lower, based on your instruction. (If you guess $39990, but $39990 is already taken, I will move your guess to the next available slot, based on your ""higher or lower"".)
    Guesses will be accepted until 5 Jan 2024 00:00:00 UTC.
    You must submit an actual number, not ""Whatever the open is on 6 Jan"".
    I reserve the right to toss your entry if you're a pain in the ass about it.

The person with the closest guess will get 0.00125 BTC. Once all the entries are in, I will post the guesses here. I will include my guess as well.",2023-12-26 15:21:38

Here is my thesis why Bitcoin is undervalued relative to gold,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/18li2oy/here_is_my_thesis_why_bitcoin_is_undervalued/,7,"Cast your mind back to mid-October. The price of Bitcoin was $27K, bulls were waiting for confirmation of a spot ETF, and bears were waiting for one last capitulation. Since then the price has increased +55% to $42K at the time of writing; the price briefly hit $44k in early December. The price rally was driven by rumours that the SEC will confirm the spot ETF - they actually delayed the decision to Q1 24 - and speculation that the FED will reduce interest rates. Regardless of whether you are a bull or a bear, everyone trading or investing in Bitcoin wants to know: what is Bitcoin really worth?

One way to estimate the true value of Bitcoin is to benchmark it against something else. Bitcoin is commonly compared to Gold. This post will estimate the true value of Bitcoin by using Gold as a benchmark. Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments, has completed the first step of benchmarking Bitcoin vs Gold by comparing the fundamentals. See [this link](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/sites/default/files/documents/bitcoin-first.pdf) and comparison chart below. The conclusion is that as a store of value, Bitcoin is better or equal to gold in six out of seven characteristics. Gold beats bitcoin for a longer track record. Overall I agree with their assessment.

To estimate the true value of Bitcoin, we need to build upon Fidelity’s work. One weakness of this comparison chart is that some categories are more important than others. I have assigned an importance to each category below. This is subjective. Someone could make it more objective, but it would make the analysis more painstaking to complete and I don’t think my importance ratings will be majorly controversial anyway. 

https://i.imgur.com/n2M1WZV.png

The largest consequence of my importance ratings is that Gold is going to get a favourable comparison vs Bitcoin for winning the ‘track record’ category which has 65% importance. I think that is cautiously fair. The largest advantage of Gold is that it has been used as a store of value for over 2,500 years and I think track record is an important characteristic for most investors. Crypto investors evidently don’t care about track record, but outside of crypto a lot of investors do care. I have avoided making any dubious assumptions that benefit Bitcoin in this benchmarking analysis. I would prefer to make a confident estimate that ‘Bitcoin is worth at least X’ instead of a dubious claim that ‘Maybe Bitcoin could be worth up to X’. For example, I think I have been harsh on Bitcoin to say that ‘verifiable’ only has a 14% importance. This is an important characteristic and Bitcoin is much more verifiable than Gold. So my end calculation will under-value Bitcoin if you agree verifiable is actually more important than 14%.

Next I want to quantify the exact difference between Bitcoin and Gold given Fidelity’s ratings and my importance ratings. The first step is to assign arbitrary points for each category. The winner of a category gets 100 points, the loser gets zero points, and for a draw both Bitcoin and gold get 50 points each. Here is how the results look:

https://i.imgur.com/UOa7Vu0.png


Bitcoin investors might be shouting ‘Stop the count!’ at this point because Bitcoin looks like a better store of value than Gold. But we have not considered the importance of each category just yet. Gold is going to perform much better once we factor in the importance of ‘track record’. To consider category importance, I calculated a weighted score by multiplying the points by importance. The results are shown below.

https://i.imgur.com/vcZrqfA.png

Bitcoin scores 26 vs gold 74 after we consider the importance of each category. This result is more meaningful if you put it into a percentage: Bitcoin is 35% as good as Gold as a store of value (26/74 = 35%). This 35% is a key figure that will be used to value Bitcoin in the remainder of this post. If you disagree with 35% that’s fine, you can replicate the steps below with a different figure. For example, if you think Bitcoin is half as good as Gold, you can use 50%. To estimate the value of one bitcoin we need to gather the remaining inputs for our calculation: (Market cap of Gold * % used for investing *  35%) / supply of bitcoin.

According to [Infinite Market Cap](https://8marketcap.com/), the market cap of Gold is $13.7 trillion. The small print mentions that the market cap is the total value mined. What we are interested in is the market cap of Gold used for investing because that is the market Bitcoin is trying to capture. Bitcoin can’t be used for jewellery. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold#Monetary_use): “The world's consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewellery, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry”. The exact percentages are debated because Gold reserves are not regularly audited (if at all). A few [other sources](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/market-primer/gold-market-primer-market-size-and-structure) tend to gravitate around a 40% figure. So we will stick with 40%. Lastly there is a maximum of 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist. Not all Bitcoin has been mined yet, and some has been lost. But I will use 21 million to err on the side of a pessimistic estimate.

Put this all together and you can estimate the value of one bitcoin as ($13.7 trillion * 0.40 * 0.35) / 21 million = $91,833.

I like this analysis for three reasons. (1) It is based on the value of Gold which is a moving target and Bitcoin has a real opportunity to capture some of this market. (2) The assumptions are pretty ‘safe’. I think the biggest underlying assumption is the belief that if Bitcoin is 35% as good as Gold it should also be worth 35% of the addressable market. (3) It passes the ‘eyeball test’. The logic makes sense and the end result is a believable number.

If someone wanted to, they could also repeat this process for other markets that Bitcoin could capture. For example Bitcoin might partly capture market share of the reserve currency market cap or the real estate investment market cap. Then you could add the Gold benchmark + reserve currency benchmark + real estate market benchmark to have a final number.

For now, I am content believing that one bitcoin is worth $92K which could deliver a 119% ROI for anyone buying at the current market price.

Btw, if anyone wants a minimalist website to track the price of bitcoin over the next bull market cycle, I made [DefiDive.com](https://defidive.com/)

TLDR:

Valuation calculation vs gold =
(market cap of gold * percentage used for investing * percentage of market bitcoin should capture) / supply of bitcoin

= ($13.7 trillion * 0.40 * 0.35) / 21 million = $91,833.",2023-12-18 20:04:24

Does anyone know how to plot numbers on a log-10 graph?,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/18f56l0/does_anyone_know_how_to_plot_numbers_on_a_log10/,4,"Check my numbers

I think the approximate range for the next ATH can be estimated. 
For reference I picked the December before each halving because that is the month we are in. One could pick a different month or number of months before the halving date, or the low since the last halving.
Also, this doesn’t take into account other functions that Bitcoin may fulfill in time. Standard of money. Increasing use as a currency. Endless possibilities. These could and likely would increase bitcoin’s value further. 
In the year after the first halving in July 2012, price went from around $2.32 in December 2011 to $190 in April 2013. 82x. 10.5M btc were mined 50%
After the second halving price went from $396 in December 2015 to $19720 in December of 2017, 49x. 15.75M btc had been mined. 75% 
3rd, $7200 December 2019-$68,000 in November 2021. 9x 18.375M bitcoin mined. 87.5%
As we approach the next halving in April 2024, we are around $44,000. 93.75% of Bitcoin will have been mined. 
As you can see, after each halving the price goes up, but less so after each subsequent event. 
Plotting each ATH against the % mined is only meaningful on a logarithmic scale. If X axis is % mined and Y axis is price in log, one sees a rather straight line up and to the right. 
This is where I am out of my water. I’m searching on excel to find a formula that would express the relation of the ATH log-10 versus the % of Bitcoin mined. Eyeballing a rough log-10 graph, it appears to be in the range of $200,000. 
The other item O noticed when plotting these numbers is that the movement along the X or % mined axis are getting closer and closer together. So even though the ATH increases logarithmically, the increasingly smaller movement along the C axis limits the corresponding result on the Y axis. 
As we know, this halving will progress until the last whole bitcoin is mined. 
For the mathematical experts in the sub please take this from here.  
Thanks.",2023-12-10 14:49:37

ELI5: What is the effect of inflow of liquidity and the downstream impact on 1) market cap and BTC price vs. 2) the ‘multiplier effect’ on BTC price?,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/18eraz0/eli5_what_is_the_effect_of_inflow_of_liquidity/,6,"Repost. Original post inappropriately deleted from r/Bitcoin by a bot.

My understanding is incomplete. Be kind. I’m learning.

I’m trying to understand how smaller inflows of capital could result in a disproportionate increase in bitcoin price without the need for large movements in market cap e.g. the so-called ‘multiplier effect’ that Bank of America reported.

I see one-sided arguments on why a $250k+ bitcoin price “is” and “is not” possible this bull cycle. However, these arguments do not often incorporate both the ‘Market Cap’ and ‘Multiplier Effect‘ perspectives.

Are there any examples of the multiplier effect in other asset classes where the price moved substantially without large capital inflows?
