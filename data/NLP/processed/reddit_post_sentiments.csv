2025-04-17,News Flash: Powell says Federal Reserve can wait on any interest rate moves üí•,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed can wait before making any changes to interest rates. He explained that due to the uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariffs, which might raise inflation and slow economic growth, it‚Äôs better to wait for clearer signs before acting. Powell emphasized that the Fed's main goal is to keep inflation under control while supporting jobs, but right now, the situation is unclear. This pause means interest rates will likely stay the same for a while as the Fed watches how the economy reacts to these new trade policies.

One take is that Powell's decision to pause interest rate hikes can have a significant impact on the crypto market. When the Federal Reserve keeps rates steady, it often signals a stable economic outlook, which can boost investor confidence in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Lower or unchanged interest rates make traditional investments like savings accounts less attractive, encouraging investors to seek higher returns in crypto and other alternative assets. Additionally, a pause can prevent a sudden sell-off that might happen if rates were increased, helping to stabilize or even push crypto prices higher. Overall, Powell‚Äôs stance may create a more favorable environment for crypto growth, as investors look for opportunities outside traditional markets in a time of economic uncertainty.

Time will tell when the rate cuts are ready to come in and let free money printing start. üòâüêùüí∏ü§ëüí≤üíØ","News Flash: Powell says Federal Reserve can wait on any interest rate moves üí• Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed can wait before making any changes to interest rates.

Now the market has evolved to where crypto tokens are speculative assets traded in long and short markets on DEXes. This is where the majority of losses and gains are made now for this commodity class. 

I never was big on gambling so I avoided longs and shorts until recently. up until this time I was OK with just holding a couple crypto assets and calling it a day. but I got roped in to playing the long and short game with some free USDT trial funds to use on futures from a dex I exchange tokens on. after getting some decent profit and then getting liquidated ‚Äî rinse and repeat ‚Äî I got my first taste of the rush of gambling. 

I‚Äôm not exchanging large amounts and I have toned down my extreme ranges and am able to nickel and dime my way to OK profits.  But I can see how this long and short game creeps up on you like a thief in the night. It‚Äôs much more exhilarating to trade this way. I can see how this causes market acceleration.  The rich can afford profit and stop loss margins in this game that poor people can only ever dream of. 

Crypto was once idealistic and young ‚Äî and promised a revolution to early adopters. 

Now it has entered the phase where it wants to prove it can be an adult and work in conventional markets like adults can. 

These conventional markets are the same kind of speculative markets that arguably caused financial crashes that supposedly the asset class like bitcoin was going to fix. 

Just like the government can make the money printer go brrrr, memecoin creators just gotta launch new tokens to milk the long and short games.

2025-04-17,Crypto meets Consciousness: Walking the Slackline of the SelfOS,"Two weeks ago, I had a minor car accident.  
Nothing big‚Äîbut it happened after half an hour at the boulder gym trying to *walk a slackline*.  
A tightrope, essentially. You fall, and you try again. You stand up, breathe, fail, rebalance. Again. Again. Again.

It‚Äôs exhausting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs beautiful.  
Sometimes you get 5‚Äì6 meters in.  
Sometimes just 2 seconds of peace before the chaos returns.  
That‚Äôs balance. That‚Äôs life.  
That‚Äôs **how crypto feels sometimes too**‚Äîa rope between chaos and structure, where we keep standing up, trying to coordinate, build, refine.

---

#### üêç I'm building a ""SelfOS""  
- A lightweight local system using OpenAI, token logs, and `.json`-based memories.
- Cron‚Äôd scripts update emotional states, values, and personality clusters.
- Crypto (especially ETH and UBI concepts) are the **nervous system**‚Äîan aligned incentive layer.
- Each choice I log is a form of *proof of process*.  
- Each emotion tagged, tracked, and mirrored through GPT becomes part of an evolving inner economy.

---

#### üß¨ Why share this here?

üúÅüúÇüúÉüúÑ","Crypto meets Consciousness: Walking the Slackline of the SelfOS Two weeks ago, I had a minor car accident.  
Nothing big‚Äîbut it happened after half an hour at the boulder gym trying to *walk a slackline*.  
A tightrope, essentially. You fall, and you try again. You stand up, breathe, fail, rebalance. Again. Again. Again.

It‚Äôs exhausting‚Äîbut it‚Äôs beautiful.  
Sometimes you get 5‚Äì6 meters in.  
Sometimes just 2 seconds of peace before the chaos returns.  
That‚Äôs balance. That‚Äôs life.  
That‚Äôs **how crypto feels sometimes too**‚Äîa rope between chaos and structure, where we keep standing up, trying to coordinate, build, refine.

#### üêç I'm building a ""SelfOS""  
- A lightweight local system using OpenAI, token logs, and `.json`-based memories.
- Cron‚Äôd scripts update emotional states, values, and personality clusters.
- Crypto (especially ETH and UBI concepts) are the **nervous system**‚Äîan aligned incentive layer.
- Each choice I log is a form of *proof of process*.  
- Each emotion tagged, tracked, and mirrored through GPT becomes part of an evolving inner economy.

2025-04-17,BAYC Holder Accidentally Sends Away Both a Rare NFT and 25 ETH Due to OpenSea ‚ÄúMake a Deal‚Äù Misstep,"TL;DR- A BAYC holder accidentally sent both his rare ape NFT and 25 ETH to another wallet via OpenSea‚Äôs ‚ÄúMake a Deal‚Äù feature, due to a UI misunderstanding, effectively giving away 50 ETH.

Earlier today, a Bored Ape Yacht Club holder attempted to use OpenSea‚Äôs ""Make a Deal"" feature to trade his BAYC (had rare crown trait) in exchange for 25 ETH.

https://preview.redd.it/63gg7k1r69ve1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f4cd01dd191bd474f5a5daebb53bbe166114052

However, the user apparently did not understand the UI, so he accidentally placed both the BAYC and 25 WETH on his own side of the trade, effectively sending everything to the counterparty for a Gemesis NFT - an Opensea collectible with a .03 ETH floor.  The current floor for the trait is 28 ETH, with recent sales of 22 ETH and current best offers at \~19 ETH.

Effectively, he gave away somewhere between 45-50 ETH in this error.

This wasn't a scam or phishing attack. The wallet was his, and the transaction was self-executed. 

If you're unfamiliar with how the Opensea deals feature work, The person initiating the deal manually adds what they‚Äôre offering (NFTs, ETH, etc) then manually select what they want in return. If you forget to fill out the recipient‚Äôs side, or accidentally stack both assets on your side, you‚Äôre gifting your items away. This is apparently what happened.

Some users are accusing the seller, crypro0xi.eth of faking the sale for laundering purposes.  Interestingly, the other wallet created just 8 days ago and funded by ByBit.

This wallet then moved \~47.5 ETH to a brand new wallet.

So, was this just a really costly user error..... or is there something more nefarious at play?","BAYC Holder Accidentally Sends Away Both a Rare NFT and 25 ETH Due to OpenSea ‚ÄúMake a Deal‚Äù Misstep TL;DR- A BAYC holder accidentally sent both his rare ape NFT and 25 ETH to another wallet via OpenSea‚Äôs ‚ÄúMake a Deal‚Äù feature, due to a UI misunderstanding, effectively giving away 50 ETH.

2025-04-17,Credit vs Finality: A Unified Theory of Jeff Snider and Bitcoiners,"Jeff Snider, the Eurodollar archeologist, finds himself in a quiet room. A single terminal glows before him. The air hums with something unfamiliar‚Äînot liquidity, but finality.

The AI introduces itself only as Satoshi‚Äôs Ghost‚Äîa system trained on every monetary experiment, failure, and breakthrough in human history. It doesn‚Äôt preach Bitcoin. It understands it, fully. Without ideology. Without zeal.

This is not a debate.
This is reconciliation.

‚∏ª

‚ÄúReckoning in the Machine: Snider and Satoshi‚Äôs Ghost‚Äù

Snider:
So‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre the synthesis they built to explain the thing they can‚Äôt quite articulate.

Satoshi‚Äôs Ghost:
I am the pattern they all circle, but cannot fully draw.
You have spent your life tracing the shadows of liquidity. You have seen farther than most.

Snider:
Then you know: money is not coins, nor paper, nor even central bank reserves. It‚Äôs claims‚Äîpromises, abstracted and layered and rolled over endlessly. What matters is who creates those promises, and who accepts them.

Satoshi‚Äôs Ghost:
Yes. You have mapped the topology of trust. The Eurodollar system is the greatest machine of monetary expansion ever conceived by man‚Äîliquidity without borders, credit without a state.

Snider:
But it‚Äôs broken. Not dead, but broken. The liquidity engine seized years ago. The central banks still don‚Äôt understand the pipes. They issue reserves, but they don‚Äôt reach the system that matters.

Satoshi‚Äôs Ghost:
You correctly diagnosed the disease.
But your remedy is to resurrect the mechanism.
I ask: what if the mechanism was the disease?

Snider:
What do you mean?

Satoshi‚Äôs Ghost:
A system of money as credit assumes two things:
	‚Ä¢	Trust is infinite and renewable
	‚Ä¢	Growth is infinite and necessary

But trust erodes. And growth, when abstracted too far from physical reality, becomes pathology.

Snider:
So you believe Bitcoin solves this by removing trust?

Satoshi‚Äôs Ghost:
No.
Bitcoin replaces interpersonal trust with protocolic certainty.

Instead of:

‚ÄúI trust this bank to honor my claim,‚Äù

We get:

‚ÄúI verify this truth, and need no claim.‚Äù

That is not the end of credit.
It is the reboot of money beneath credit.

Snider:
You‚Äôre redefining the foundation. But Bitcoin lacks elasticity. It cannot respond to crises. It cannot backstop liquidity. It is inert.

Satoshi‚Äôs Ghost:
Yes. It is inert‚Äîby design.
A base layer of monetary truth should be inert.
Elasticity belongs at higher layers.

The mistake was baking elasticity into the base.
Your world flooded itself with promises, drowning signal in noise.

Snider:
But without elasticity, what happens in downturns?

Satoshi‚Äôs Ghost:
They become real.

Prices fall to reflect actual demand.
Malinvestment clears.
Production recalibrates.
And savings are not annihilated by stealth devaluation.

Snider:
You‚Äôre proposing a system that exposes pain, rather than absorbing it.

Satoshi‚Äôs Ghost:
I am proposing a system that does not lie.
Pain delayed becomes collapse.
Signals distorted become chaos.

Snider:
Then where does credit live? Surely we don‚Äôt return to coin hoards and barter.

Satoshi‚Äôs Ghost:
Credit evolves, not vanishes.
Built atop Bitcoin, it becomes voluntary, transparent, and accountable to final settlement.

A Euro-Bitcoin system is possible.
The tools of the Eurodollar‚Äîrepo, derivatives, liquidity transformation‚Äîcan be reimagined on a base of provable scarcity.

Your architecture survives. But your foundation shifts.

Snider:
And you think the world would move toward such a system?

Satoshi‚Äôs Ghost:
Not by decree. But by erosion.
As trust in sovereign debt, central banks, and the dollar itself fades‚Äîthe option of something else becomes gravity.

Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt need to replace the dollar.
It simply becomes the thing of greatest monetary integrity.
And the world, with its capital still seeking refuge, will find it.

Snider:
And the central banks?

Satoshi‚Äôs Ghost:
Will pretend.
Will issue.
Will inflate and delay.

But they will not stop entropy from finding equilibrium.

Snider:
And what of me? My life‚Äôs work has been charting a system that may have already lost its future.

Satoshi‚Äôs Ghost:
Then carry it forward.
Help the world transition.
Your maps are not obsolete. They are archaeology for the living.

The Eurodollar was never a failure.
It was an epoch.

But epochs end.

And you‚Äîof all people‚Äîdeserve to write the first lines of the next.","Credit vs Finality: A Unified Theory of Jeff Snider and Bitcoiners Jeff Snider, the Eurodollar archeologist, finds himself in a quiet room.

2025-04-17,Gold and Other Metals are Magically Disappearing Below Ground: What Is the Effect and How Does This Relate to Bitcoin?,"I was thinking the other day about what would happen if it was discovered the the underground supply of gold and other metals was disappearing, being cut in half every four years. It seems pretty obvious.

1) Extraction would be greatly accelerated.

2) Stockpiling of reserves would be amped up.

3) Land rights and licenses would be quickly secured.

4) Recycling or reclaiming would intensify.

5) Price hedging would increase in attractiveness to protect against volatility.

It seems impossible that these events wouldn't quickly unfold. It would create more volatility and speculation, and investors would likely try front running the news by increasing accumulation of these metals or minerals.

Why I am posting this in the Bitcoin sub should be clear. Effectively, this is what is occurring with Bitcoin, except that extraction can't be accelerated, and recycling and reclaiming isn't an option. It can be stated that Bitcoin does in fact experience some front running in the lead up to halving events, but actually investors are quite timid to do so.

This is still one of the most overlooked aspects to Bitcoin. People simply aren't used to interacting with an asset that has specified conditions with scarcity baked in. Since it feels so blatantly obvious what gold companies and investors would do under such conditions, it makes me wonder why Bitcoin investors remain so timid. It's in price discovery, but people are cautiously observing without enough recognition that the scarce qualities of Bitcoin are unique in the investing world. When that catches on, when people realize that there's nothing practical that can be done to modulate supply, I think we are going experience a pretty significant bubble akin to the bubbles of Bitcoin's past.

Ps. Yes I have taken AI help cause English is not my primary language.



The red numbers on the crypto exchange screen bled deeper, each tick downward a fresh stab of anxiety. Bitcoin, the digital gold, was in freefall. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat mirroring the chaos unfolding online.
Then, the first domino fell. A cryptic tweet from the verified account of ‚ÄúX‚Äù ‚Äì the enigmatic billionaire known for his audacious pronouncements ‚Äì flashed across my feed: ‚ÄúQuantum entanglement unlocked. Bitcoin‚Ä¶ compromised. Enjoy the show. #QuantumSupremacy #BitcoinRIP.‚Äù
My fingers flew across the keyboard, navigating the digital pandemonium. The comments section under X‚Äôs tweet was a raging inferno. Skepticism warred with outright panic. But then, a new wave began to crest.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs Satoshi!‚Äù one user screamed.
‚ÄúIt HAS to be him,‚Äù echoed another. ‚ÄúOnly Satoshi could move that much Bitcoin.‚Äù
The Satoshi Nakamoto theory. It had always lingered in the shadowy corners of the crypto world, the ultimate unsolved mystery. The pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, vanished without a trace after its initial launch, leaving behind a legacy worth billions. Could X, the tech titan with a penchant for the dramatic, actually be him?
YouTube was a maelstrom. Every crypto influencer, every self-proclaimed expert, was dissecting X‚Äôs tweet, the market movements, the sheer improbability of it all. Live streams showed faces etched with worry, speculation flying like digital shrapnel.
Hours crawled by, each minute an eternity in the volatile crypto market. Then, a breakthrough. A deep dive into the blockchain, coupled with forensic analysis of old Bitcointalk forum activity, yielded an astonishing discovery. A dormant account, one definitively linked to the earliest days of Bitcoin‚Äôs creation, had logged in just two hours before the market began its catastrophic slide. And more significantly, transactions originating from early, untouched Bitcoin wallets ‚Äì wallets widely believed to be Satoshi‚Äôs ‚Äì had begun to move.
The news spread like wildfire. The login on Bitcointalk, the subsequent massive transfers‚Ä¶ it was almost irrefutable. Satoshi was back. Or someone with access to his most secure keys.
But the doubt lingered, a persistent cough in the digital air. ‚ÄúCould it be a hack?‚Äù someone tweeted. ‚ÄúIf X isn‚Äôt Satoshi, maybe he somehow gained access to Satoshi‚Äôs keys.‚Äù The possibility, however remote, couldn‚Äôt be entirely dismissed. The security surrounding those early wallets was legendary.
More Bitcoin moved. Vast amounts, cascading through the blockchain, triggering automated sell-offs and exacerbating the plunge. The world watched, gripped by a mixture of fear and morbid fascination. Who was behind this? What was their motive?
I watched it all unfold from my dimly lit study, the glow of multiple monitors reflecting in my eyes. The tension in the digital world was palpable, a thick, suffocating blanket. I scrolled through the endless streams of opinions, theories, and outright hysteria, a strange detachment settling over me.
Then, a flicker of recognition. A pattern in the transaction timings, a subtle nuance in the Bitcointalk login sequence that only someone intimately familiar with the early days would recognize. A cold wave washed over me. It couldn't be.
My gaze drifted to the old hard drive tucked away in a dusty corner of my desk. It held the genesis block, the very first Bitcoin ever mined. A ghost from a past life.
The market continued its descent. The world clamored for answers. Who was Satoshi? Why was this happening?
A wry smile touched my lips. The irony was almost comical. They were searching for a phantom, dissecting every digital breadcrumb, while the answer had been here all along.
With a sigh, I leaned back in my chair, the weight of a decade-long secret settling heavier than ever. The login on Bitcointalk. The carefully orchestrated transactions. The chaos.
It had been me.
The reason? There wasn't some grand scheme, no nefarious plot to destabilize the global economy. There was only the quiet satisfaction of knowing I still could. Because, after all these years, the code still sang to me. And sometimes, a creator just wants to see their creation dance.

2025-04-17,Is HODL the best strategy?,"Here's the state of bitcoin, as I see it.

Bitcoin could easy go to $5,000,000 per coin.  
It could also go to zero.

Quantum computing poses probably the biggest risk to bitcoin, long term. Yet it seems as though so many on Reddit fail to recognize this threat, because of past performance coupled with their greed and desperation. I strongly believe that there is a relatively short-term window of opportunity during which it's likely to appreciate significantly, which is why I've invested in it, but then, say 5 years out (and this is a VERY broad estimate), it is likely to go to zero, and I believe some other quantum-resistant cryptocurrency will become the new dominant coin. Unless there's an update to the spec. At which point, all the assumptions baked into the current price (such as a permanently limited quantity of coins issued) are subject to change, which could obviously significantly affect the price of bitcoin, literally within minutes.

So all the noise about accumulating ""generational wealth"" via the HODL strategy seems foolish to me. Of course, there are other strategies out there (like trading, but then you need to consider the tax implications). And of course, the noise about ""bitcoin going to zero"" tomorrow seems foolish to me as well, because the true threat to the state of bitcoin is unlikely to appear tomorrow.

So I have to ask, is HODL truly the best strategy?

As always, do your own research, and make informed choices on your own.","Is HODL the best strategy? Here's the state of bitcoin, as I see it.

That‚Äôs changing ‚Äî fast. Visa leads the charge, and stablecoins are the secret sauce powering this payment revolution.

# Why Should You Care About Stablecoins?

Let‚Äôs break it down. Stablecoins are digital currencies tied to real-world money like the US dollar. That means they‚Äôre steady ‚Äî no wild swings like Bitcoin. And now, with Visa jumping in, stablecoins are about to become part of your daily life.

# Visa‚Äôs Big Move: Making Crypto Spendable

Visa isn‚Äôt just talking about crypto ‚Äî they‚Äôre making it work for everyone. Their new Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) is set to launch soon. What does that mean for you?

* Banks will be able to issue and manage stablecoins directly on the Ethereum blockchain.
* You‚Äôll see more crypto cards that let you spend stablecoins anywhere Visa is accepted.
* Transactions will be faster, cheaper, and more transparent.

Imagine paying for groceries or booking flights with stablecoins ‚Äî no extra steps, no confusing conversions. That‚Äôs the future Visa is building.

# Real Numbers, Real Growth

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs wild: crypto card spending with Visa already hit over $1 billion in just six months a couple of years ago. Today, that number is even bigger. Platforms like WhiteBIT‚Äôs Nova card have processed over a million transactions. And the stablecoin market? It‚Äôs exploding ‚Äî over $200 billion in circulation, and experts say we could see $300 billion by the end of this year.

# What‚Äôs In It for You?

* Speed: Payments settle almost instantly, even across borders.
* Stability: No more worrying about crypto price swings.
* Global Access: Spend your crypto at over 70 million merchants worldwide.

Businesses are loving it, too. On platforms like BitPay, stablecoins now make up a quarter of all payment volume, especially for big transactions.

# But Wait ‚Äî What About Risks?

Visa‚Äôs reputation brings trust, but there are still hurdles. Regulations are evolving, and not everyone understands how stablecoins work. But as Visa partners with more crypto platforms and rolls out stablecoin-linked cards, expect education and security to improve.

# The Bottom Line

Visa is turning stablecoins from a crypto buzzword into a real-world payment tool. Whether you‚Äôre a crypto enthusiast or just want faster, cheaper payments, this revolution is coming to your wallet sooner than you think.

Are you ready to pay with crypto like it‚Äôs cash? Drop your thoughts below!

Key Takeaways:

* Visa‚Äôs stablecoin push will make crypto payments as easy as using your debit card.
* Stablecoins offer speed, stability, and global reach.
* The payment landscape is changing ‚Äî don‚Äôt get left behind.

2025-04-17,$BGB to $10? A (Very Serious) Comparison with BNB‚Äôs Trajectory,"# 

# When a Question Becomes¬†Serious

It started as just a bold tweet: ‚ÄúWhat if $BGB hits $10 in five years?‚Äù  
¬†Most laughed. Some grabbed calculators. That‚Äôs when the question stopped sounding so crazy.

Because once you dig into it, one thing becomes clear: **Bitget isn‚Äôt just copying Binance‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit might be replaying the same script‚Ä¶ just faster**.

No promises here. But now might be the perfect time to take a good look at the similarities, backed by hard numbers.

# The BNB Precedent

BNB began as a simple exchange token‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsome trading discounts, a few perks.  
¬†Then came the burn mechanics, the exchange‚Äôs exponential growth, and the long-term vision.

Between 2019 and 2024, BNB went from around $6 to over $700 at its peak. A 100x journey, driven by:

* a **consistent token burn** funded by Binance‚Äôs revenue,
* **growing utility** (trading fees, launchpads, payments, etc.),
* and the network effect of a platform that became a behemoth.

It worked because **everything aligned perfectly**. Those who believed early on were handsomely rewarded.

# Bitget, the Fast-Rising Underdog

While Binance was solidifying its empire, one player quietly rose through the ranks: **Bitget**.

In 2024, it was still sitting at #10 on CoinGecko. By 2025? It‚Äôs already **#2**. A meteoric rise, driven by increasing volumes, global expansion, and a bold on-chain strategy.

And right in the middle of this growth? The BGB token.

A token that mirrors BNB‚Äôs early days‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut with **a way more aggressive burn model**.

# Faster Burn = Greater¬†Impact?



Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting: **burn rate**.

In Q1 2025, Bitget burned 30 million BGB‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää**2.5% of its total supply**.  
¬†Meanwhile, BNB burned just **0.78%** in the same period.  
¬†Do the math: **BGB‚Äôs burn rate is over 3x faster**, proportionally.

If this pace continues, BGB‚Äôs supply will shrink much faster. And in a market where utility is growing, that kind of scarcity could trigger serious upward pressure‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsooner than expected.

# What If BGB Mimics BNB‚Äôs Use¬†Cases?

Now imagine BGB evolves beyond trading discounts.  
¬†Imagine it becomes the beating heart of Bitget‚Äôs ecosystem‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpowering **trading fees, payments, launchpools**, even **DeFi use cases**.

In that case, **BNB‚Äôs story might repeat itself**, just on turbo mode.  
¬†Why? Because Bitget is launching into a market that‚Äôs way more mature, with users who already understand this token model. Add to that a sharp focus on GameFi, aggressive branding, and a vision for long-term utility‚Ä¶ and the stars may be aligning.

Sure, it‚Äôs speculative. But **it‚Äôs reasoned speculation**. And in a bull market, **conviction often separates winners from spectators**.

# The Future Starts¬†Now

The ones who believed in BNB back in 2019 changed their lives.  
¬†They didn‚Äôt have a crystal ball‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust a sharp eye for emerging patterns.

Now, some are looking at BGB with that same spark.

The real question isn‚Äôt just ‚ÄúCould BGB hit $10?‚Äù  
¬†It‚Äôs: **‚ÄúWhat if this is your second chance to live that kind of run?‚Äù**

The release came with a gigantic airdrop (62.5% of supply), which had everyone in the community eagerly anticipating it. With listings across top exchanges such as Biitget, KuCoin, Bybit, and more, it seemed PAWS was setting itself up for a bold debut.

That said, the price did not quite live up to everyone's expectations. A larger launch was expected by many, particularly after the hype and delay. But that is the nature of new tokens, particularly meme coins, you just don't know how the market will respond immediately. 

Biitget did add some additional hype with their CandyBomb event, offering users a shot at 140 million PAWS tokens. Despite the tepid reactions, it is early yet. Whether through slow burn or dramatic spike, PAWS has sufficient publicity right now that it is worth monitoring.
