Eth is the worst performing crypto this cycle, where are all the eth maxis?

Are we still considering BTC the gold and eth the silver of crypto? 

What do you think went wrong with it? 
Is it because Trump lauched his memecoin on Solana?

Or Vitalik doing silly dance in functions made you change your mind? 

Many ETH maxis are now calling eth overpriced compared to other coins, like what has really changed boys?

2025-04-16,News Flash: Powell says Federal Reserve can wait on any interest rate moves 💥,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed can wait before making any changes to interest rates. He explained that due to the uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariffs, which might raise inflation and slow economic growth, it’s better to wait for clearer signs before acting. Powell emphasized that the Fed's main goal is to keep inflation under control while supporting jobs, but right now, the situation is unclear. This pause means interest rates will likely stay the same for a while as the Fed watches how the economy reacts to these new trade policies.

One take is that Powell's decision to pause interest rate hikes can have a significant impact on the crypto market. When the Federal Reserve keeps rates steady, it often signals a stable economic outlook, which can boost investor confidence in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Lower or unchanged interest rates make traditional investments like savings accounts less attractive, encouraging investors to seek higher returns in crypto and other alternative assets. Additionally, a pause can prevent a sudden sell-off that might happen if rates were increased, helping to stabilize or even push crypto prices higher. Overall, Powell’s stance may create a more favorable environment for crypto growth, as investors look for opportunities outside traditional markets in a time of economic uncertainty.

Time will tell when the rate cuts are ready to come in and let free money printing start. 😉🐝💸🤑💲💯",CryptoCurrency,155,38

Ripple is due to submit its appellate brief or the case will see a SETTLEMENT or appeal WITHDRAWAL.

For months, Ripple's CEO has confirmed an agreement with SEC staff to DISMISS the case, and just waiting for the Commission’s APPROVAL.

Now with Paul Atkins confirmed as the new SEC Chair, the outcome could hinge on his official instatement. If everything aligns, we could see a 3-1 vote in favor of putting an end to the case.

2. It has a vestment period. (Lock-up Period)
3. It has staking rewards.
4. It's tied to someone who got famous for showing and sounding out how they smoke polls.
5. It's tied to an orange in color former and current president with a Russian mail-order bride.
6. It goes up in price while every other cryptocurrency is dropping.
7. The CEO of the coin or token requests an interview from Coffeezilla to explain to him how their cryptocurrency is different from all the rest.
8. The project it's connected to makes no sense whatsoever to even have a cryptocurrency connected to it in the first place, or they tell you it's a charity or a foundation.
9. It's listed on Binance.

Nothing big—but it happened after half an hour at the boulder gym trying to *walk a slackline*.  
A tightrope, essentially. You fall, and you try again. You stand up, breathe, fail, rebalance. Again. Again. Again.

It’s exhausting—but it’s beautiful.  
Sometimes you get 5–6 meters in.  
Sometimes just 2 seconds of peace before the chaos returns.  
That’s balance. That’s life.  
That’s **how crypto feels sometimes too**—a rope between chaos and structure, where we keep standing up, trying to coordinate, build, refine.

---

#### 🐍 I'm building a ""SelfOS""  
- A lightweight local system using OpenAI, token logs, and `.json`-based memories.
- Cron’d scripts update emotional states, values, and personality clusters.
- Crypto (especially ETH and UBI concepts) are the **nervous system**—an aligned incentive layer.
- Each choice I log is a form of *proof of process*.  
- Each emotion tagged, tracked, and mirrored through GPT becomes part of an evolving inner economy.

---

#### 🧬 Why share this here?

Because the crypto space taught me coordination, transparency, incentives.  
And now I’m applying that tech inward—on the **most local node**: my Self.

If you’re experimenting with:

- DAOs for inner governance
- Tokens as value representations of mood/state
- AI agents as externalized memory extensions
- And want to weave **ritual, reflection, and recursion** into your stack

Then maybe we have something to swap.

---

**No monetization, no product—just a fellow being building publicly.**

Come walk the line with me.  
Sometimes we fall.  
But sometimes...  
we glide.

2025-04-16,BAYC Holder Accidentally Sends Away Both a Rare NFT and 25 ETH Due to OpenSea “Make a Deal” Misstep,"TL;DR- A BAYC holder accidentally sent both his rare ape NFT and 25 ETH to another wallet via OpenSea’s “Make a Deal” feature, due to a UI misunderstanding, effectively giving away 50 ETH.

Earlier today, a Bored Ape Yacht Club holder attempted to use OpenSea’s ""Make a Deal"" feature to trade his BAYC (had rare crown trait) in exchange for 25 ETH.

https://preview.redd.it/63gg7k1r69ve1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f4cd01dd191bd474f5a5daebb53bbe166114052

However, the user apparently did not understand the UI, so he accidentally placed both the BAYC and 25 WETH on his own side of the trade, effectively sending everything to the counterparty for a Gemesis NFT - an Opensea collectible with a .03 ETH floor.  The current floor for the trait is 28 ETH, with recent sales of 22 ETH and current best offers at \~19 ETH.

Effectively, he gave away somewhere between 45-50 ETH in this error.

https://preview.redd.it/2az39eim49ve1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=f84a61d4f05ade1f5565d1a7a1f6ef69724ddd11

This wasn't a scam or phishing attack. The wallet was his, and the transaction was self-executed. 

If you're unfamiliar with how the Opensea deals feature work, The person initiating the deal manually adds what they’re offering (NFTs, ETH, etc) then manually select what they want in return. If you forget to fill out the recipient’s side, or accidentally stack both assets on your side, you’re gifting your items away. This is apparently what happened.

Some users are accusing the seller, crypro0xi.eth of faking the sale for laundering purposes.  Interestingly, the other wallet created just 8 days ago and funded by ByBit.

This wallet then moved \~47.5 ETH to a brand new wallet.

So, was this just a really costly user error..... or is there something more nefarious at play?",CryptoCurrency,0,8

Just try, when you find someone spewing something like ""PoW is better that PoS"", ask them questions, like ""Why?"", then keep asking ""Why?"" until they reach the ""I have no fucking idea"" phase. It feels like political propaganda at that point, people just repeating whatever they heard, even if it goes against their interest, or straight makes zero sense. Heck at that point it's even like religions, just repeat whatever you heard instead of reading the damn book, which would make you realize how you've been repeating the wrong message.

So that's it? Even something like crypto is now controlled by the propaganda machine? We can't have interesting discussions about how things work and might work?

Serious question—how long are y’all gonna keep DCA’ing into the “infinite dip” before you stop pretending this is strategy and admit it’s just hope?

Every day the price drops, and every day there’s someone in the comments like, “Just bought more!” Like bro, you’re not averaging your cost—you’re averaging your losses. That’s not investing, that’s wishful thinking with a side of cognitive dissonance.

I get it, DCA works when there’s upward momentum eventually, but what part of “no signs of recovery and no real adoption” are y’all ignoring? At some point, someone’s gotta say, “Hey… maybe this isn’t just a dip. Maybe this is the descent.”

But nah, y’all treat every red candle like it’s a buying opportunity and every critique like it’s an attack. You cheer for losses like it’s noble suffering. What exactly are you supporting? The idea of crypto? The culture? Or just the bags you’re too emotionally attached to let go of?

2025-04-16,Why does it seem like Crypto rises during Democratic leadership but falls during Authoritarian leadership?,"For a while under Biden the future of Crypto seemed to be taking off and expanding in ways that I didn't expect but progress is progress. There was a slow rise in Crypto during the Obama years, but it seems like during Trumps first and his current administration, it's questionable at best if Crypto has any kind of real value. 

I expected it to rise if the value of the dollar or issues with the stock market as Crypto offers a number of personal or independent banking options and value upon reputation of ownership. 

But Trump tanked the markets, which tanked the dollar, which tanked trade which is tanking Crypto. The chain of events seem to point that the value of Crypto is dependent on the value of trust with the United States, the Dollar and the Stock market. 

I'll admit, there's hidden variables here that I'm trying to grasp and comprehend the interactions of. I expected Trump to destabilize the markets with the trade war but also expected Crypto to rise and dominate.

2025-04-16,"""How a 4 year plan always gained at least 30%"" (long-form post, part of a Bitcoin book project)","This is a section I drafted as part of a small book about Bitcoin for normies.

My goal is to be conservative while still showing how long-term DCA is powerful. So the 5.25 year HODL is based on reaching the threshold where you **never** see a loss of initial savings. I purposely leave out **max** gains. And the DCA calculations assume buying at the day's high and paying an exchange fee.

All feedback welcome!  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My good friend, Mark, a dad who saves smart with a 401(k), loves the idea of a nest egg. He sometimes buys a little Bitcoin. But soon after, he’ll sell it all. I asked him why and he said, “The price fluctuations are extremely wild. It’s too hard to stomach.”

Mark’s worry about Bitcoin’s price swings is common—people call it ‘too risky.’ People have bought Bitcoin, experienced a sudden drop in price, and then sold out of fear.

Let’s take a look at two key insights that change the game:

**Insight #1**: Sticking with Bitcoin over time is like having a secret weapon.

**Fact #1: If you held Bitcoin for at least 5 ¼ years you’d have at least kept your money—or gained a lot more**

Pick any time in the last 10 years and pretend you bought $1 worth. Fast forward five and a quarter years and your Bitcoin would be worth *at least* $1.

That’s the *worst* outcome – you’d break even and keep all your money. The *average* outcome was way better that $1 became $35. Because even though the price jumps around a lot, the long-term trend has been strongly up.

So when someone says, “I lost money in Bitcoin,” the real issue is they didn’t hold long enough.

**Insight #2**: Adding a daily savings plan gives your savings a superpower.

**Fact #2: A 4 year plan always gained at least 30%**

Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) means buying a little more on a frequent basis, no matter the price. For example, if you commit to buying $1 of Bitcoin each and every day, that’s DCA.

In every 4-year stretch over the last 10 years, that $1,460 turned into at least $1,900. That’s a 30% gain—at minimum.

Let’s compare that to a traditional savings method:

* A CD (Certificate of Deposit) might earn you around 4.5% per year.
* After 4 years in a CD, you’d have about $1,570.
* That’s only a 7.5% gain.

And remember, that 30% gain was the *worst* outcome in Bitcoin’s 10-year history. The *average* outcome turned that $1,460 into about $6,000. You’d have four times your money.

Sticking with a plan for longer than four years gave you an even greater reward. Here’s how that daily $1 habit worked out over longer time frames:

| Time Frame | Minimum Gain | Average Gain |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 4 Years    | 30%          | 300%          |
| 5 Years    | 48%          | 572%          |
| 6 Years    | 126%         | 1,058%        |
| 7 Years    | 334%         | 839%          |
| 8 Years    | 794%         | 1,365%        |
***Different time frames and their performance with a daily DCA plan***

Remember, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Bitcoin may not do this well in the future, or it could do even better. Either way it’s important to understand its track record and see how powerful it is with the right plan.",Bitcoin,12,1

hey folks — just wanted to share something i think many of you will appreciate.

i recently sat down with **chang-wu chen**, chief scientist at **imToken**, for a deep, honest conversation about crypto wallet design, onboarding, and the long road to mass adoption.

this is **not a paid promotion** — no sponsorship, no incentives. just a thoughtful conversation with someone who’s been in the trenches since the early days of ethereum, working on proof-of-stake at the EF and, might i say, a conduit to rollups becoming a solution :O

we talked about:

* wallet UX and the limitations of EOAs
* gasless onboarding and trust-based design
* why fragmentation keeps new users out
* the tension between infrastructure and experience
* and how imToken is quietly building for real users (plus a nod to their hardware wallet, imKey, and built-in DEX, Tokenlon)

changwu brings a rare mix of deep protocol insight and product-level humility — and honestly, it was one of the most grounded crypto convos i’ve had in a while.

2025-04-16,Why swapping token to token uses both ERC-20 approve() and EIP-2612 permit()?,"https://preview.redd.it/sj78j9ut26ve1.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef8dfd77030c36f67507d96ea5b1d485f21eca80

I'm learning smart contracts. As my knowledge, there are two ways to delegate token to others:

1) use an ERC-20  `approve()`, sign and broadcast the transaction

2) use an EIP-712 offline signature, give the signature to others, when they want to spend my token, they may use `permit()` and broadcast my signature

But when I tried to use uniswap or pancake to swap some token to another token, I found I have to sign for three times:

1) sign an approve() and broadcast it (for example, as https://basescan.org/tx/0x92deddfa4655d4699f61bfb2140331988b9a283dff54e4ffda984f916460d1d1)

2) sign an permit offlinely

3) sign an swap transaction (for example, https://basescan.org/tx/0x8c66fe05c339ae53a6b3fd26705f76773ae1fc4a965a24949659bcd033fcdf91) and this transaction seems to be used my signature in step 2

My questions are:

1) Why I need to sign a permit after I had already used approve() to give access to my token?

2) Why the swap transaction is broadcasted by my address, rather than the swap contract address?

When the price pumps, everyone shows up. When it dumps, most vanish. But a real community? That sticks around no matter what. I’ve seen projects with zero hype survive just because the people refused to let it die. Charts matter, sure, but community keeps things alive when everything else fades.

2025-04-16,Visa’s Stablecoin Revolution: How Crypto Is Entering Everyday Payments,"Have you ever wondered why you can tap your card at a coffee shop and pay instantly, but crypto still feels stuck in the future? That’s changing — fast. Visa leads the charge, and stablecoins are the secret sauce powering this payment revolution.

# Why Should You Care About Stablecoins?

Let’s break it down. Stablecoins are digital currencies tied to real-world money like the US dollar. That means they’re steady — no wild swings like Bitcoin. And now, with Visa jumping in, stablecoins are about to become part of your daily life.

# Visa’s Big Move: Making Crypto Spendable

Visa isn’t just talking about crypto — they’re making it work for everyone. Their new Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) is set to launch soon. What does that mean for you?

* Banks will be able to issue and manage stablecoins directly on the Ethereum blockchain.
* You’ll see more crypto cards that let you spend stablecoins anywhere Visa is accepted.
* Transactions will be faster, cheaper, and more transparent.

Imagine paying for groceries or booking flights with stablecoins — no extra steps, no confusing conversions. That’s the future Visa is building.

# Real Numbers, Real Growth

Here’s what’s wild: crypto card spending with Visa already hit over $1 billion in just six months a couple of years ago. Today, that number is even bigger. Platforms like WhiteBIT’s Nova card have processed over a million transactions. And the stablecoin market? It’s exploding — over $200 billion in circulation, and experts say we could see $300 billion by the end of this year.

# What’s In It for You?

* Speed: Payments settle almost instantly, even across borders.
* Stability: No more worrying about crypto price swings.
* Global Access: Spend your crypto at over 70 million merchants worldwide.

Businesses are loving it, too. On platforms like BitPay, stablecoins now make up a quarter of all payment volume, especially for big transactions.

# But Wait — What About Risks?

Visa’s reputation brings trust, but there are still hurdles. Regulations are evolving, and not everyone understands how stablecoins work. But as Visa partners with more crypto platforms and rolls out stablecoin-linked cards, expect education and security to improve.

# The Bottom Line

Visa is turning stablecoins from a crypto buzzword into a real-world payment tool. Whether you’re a crypto enthusiast or just want faster, cheaper payments, this revolution is coming to your wallet sooner than you think.

Are you ready to pay with crypto like it’s cash? Drop your thoughts below!

Key Takeaways:

* Visa’s stablecoin push will make crypto payments as easy as using your debit card.
* Stablecoins offer speed, stability, and global reach.
* The payment landscape is changing — don’t get left behind.

Want more tips on how to ride the next wave of digital payments? Stick around — this is just the beginning.

2025-04-17,Would it be wise to park my money in PAXG instead of USD?,"Right now, my funds are in FDUSD on Binance Earn, earning a 10% APR. With growing concerns that the Federal Reserve may implement policies leading to further devaluation of the US dollar, I’m considering moving those funds into PAXG, which is backed by physical gold. I don’t plan to withdraw from the exchange yet, as I’m anticipating a significant market dip and want to stay liquid. My main concern now is the credibility, security, and overall trust that the crypto community places in PAXG as a stable, long-term store of value.",CryptoMarkets,1,7

2025-04-16,Trump buying BTC? Miners may be the front door.,"Bo Hines (Trump’s Digital Asset advisor) just floated the idea that the U.S. could buy BTC using tariff revenues. That’s a wild thought, but if it ever materializes, you have to imagine regulators and institutions will lean on “trusted” public companies — especially compliant miners.

That’s where $MARA and $RIOT could benefit. But I’d argue $CANG deserves attention too. They’ve gone full crypto after spinning off their old China business, and are already outperforming in production efficiency. Unlike the heavy capex models, they partner with Bitmain and host globally — which gives them flexibility.

Plus, they’re holding BTC instead of dumping it — over 1,900 coins and growing. If the government ever does buy BTC, they’ll need secure, auditable supply routes. Public miners may become strategic assets.
